[00:08] [Irene Delgado]: Hi, may I speak to, um, Mr. Todd Henderson?
[00:14] [Receptionist]: Yes, I can definitely connect you over. Can I get your first and last name?
[00:19] [Irene Delgado]: Irene Delgado.
[00:21] [Receptionist]: Irene Delgado. All right. And were you wanting an update on your case?
[00:27] [Irene Delgado]: Um, yes.
[00:29] [Receptionist]: Okay, give me one moment. I'm sorry for that hold there, Irene. It does look like, um, your attorney as well as your case manager are both currently unavailable. Um, from my end, it does look like they are still negotiating, um, with those lienors, um, but I can certainly send them a message that way one of them can return your call and give you a, um, a better update.
[00:53] [Irene Delgado]: Okay, that'll be fine. Thank you.
[00:56] [Receptionist]: Mhm. You have a nice day.
[00:58] [Irene Delgado]: Thank you. Bye.
