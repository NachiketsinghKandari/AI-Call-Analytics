[00:00] [Receptionist]: This call is being recorded. McCraw Law Group, this is Jessica, how may I help you?
[00:09] [Misty Vick]: Yes, um, I need to see if by any chance y'all do extended warranty issues on cars.
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Mhm. Yeah, we do not specialize in warranty, um, issues. We do only specialize in personal injury claims having to deal with motor vehicle accidents and premises liability such as slip and falls and animal attacks. Um, so unfortunately we would not be able to help you with this, but I can provide you a referral if you are interested.
[00:37] [Misty Vick]: Yes ma'am.
[00:41] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me go ahead and pull up our referral list to see if we have, um, somebody specific for you. Um, can I get your first and last name?
[00:51] [Misty Vick]: Misty Vick.
[00:53] [Receptionist]: Misty Vick. Okay. And then how'd you hear about us, Betsy— Misty?
[00:58] [Misty Vick]: Um, actually I just Googled insurance attorneys in Amarillo.
[01:05] [Receptionist]: Insurance attorneys. Okay. Let me see here. And you said you were needing an extended warranty. Um, can you give me a bit more information on the incident?
[01:18] [Misty Vick]: Well, um, I have CarShield, mhm, and they're trying to say that my blown head gasket is a pre-existing issue.
[01:32] [Receptionist]: Okay. Interesting. Is it potentially an auto part defect that they're saying or this was caused by, you know, general wear and tear?
[01:45] [Misty Vick]: Well, no, they're trying to say that since in the documentation it says topped off fluids, that's how they're— they get in where they don't want to pay for it.
[02:00] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay.
[02:01] [Misty Vick]: Yeah, 'cause I— I take my car to Brown— Brown GMC and, you know, for my oil changes and stuff and they always top off my fluids. Mhm. You know, and when I talked to the service guy, he was like, "Misty, we do that for everybody." He's like, "It's a common courtesy, you know, we top off your fluids. That's part of an oil change." And I was like, "That's what I thought."
[02:27] [Receptionist]: Yeah, that's very—
[02:28] [Misty Vick]: So, yeah.
[02:31] [Receptionist]: Let me see who would be your best point of contact for this. Um, I don't believe we have a specific attorney to refer you to, however I can give you the phone number to the Dallas Bar Association. They're a free referral service. Um, they'll just provide you a list of attorneys after hearing your case and what's going on, um, of attorneys that could help you out and that are closest to your area. I know you were looking for an Amarillo attorney, um, so they would definitely be able to provide that information for you if you wanted to give them a call.
[03:02] [Misty Vick]: Okay.
