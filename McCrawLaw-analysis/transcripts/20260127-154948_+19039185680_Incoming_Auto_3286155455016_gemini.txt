[00:00] [Automated Voice]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, this is Dylan speaking, how can I help you?
[00:07] [Randy Barger]: Uh, hello, uh, my name is Randy Barger and uh, let me start off by asking, are y'all uh personal injury lawyers?
[00:15] [Receptionist]: We are a personal injury firm, yes sir.
[00:18] [Randy Barger]: Okay, such as like, well what I'm calling about is I had an accident in Home Depot. Uh, would that be something that y'all would handle?
[00:28] [Receptionist]: Yeah, we do handle uh premises liability cases. Did you have a slip and fall or are you talking about a—
[00:34] [Randy Barger]: Well, yes. Yes, I had a— and they agreed it was their fault. Uh, I tripped— I tripped over a pallet that they had in the— in one of their aisles and messed up my right shoulder.
[00:48] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let's see here. If you don't mind, I'm just going to go ahead and get some initial information from you. Uh, where was this Home Depot located?
[00:58] [Randy Barger]: In Cedar Park, Texas.
[01:01] [Receptionist]: Cedar Park, okay.
[01:03] [Randy Barger]: June the 19th of last year, 25.
[01:07] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me get your name put in. And then what's a good callback number for you just in case we get disconnected?
[01:14] [Randy Barger]: 903-918-5680.
[01:21] [Receptionist]: Awesome. And Randy, do you have a good email address?
[01:24] [Randy Barger]: randybarger1@yahoo.com.
[01:31] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Okay, let's see here. And Home Depot, okay. And you said in June of 25, correct?
[01:51] [Randy Barger]: Yes ma'am, June the 19th.
[01:53] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[01:54] [Randy Barger]: About— about 8:00 in the morning.
[01:56] [Receptionist]: Okay. Can you kind of walk me through what exactly happened, kind of the process?
[02:04] [Randy Barger]: Yeah. Uh, we were in there uh looking for some stuff down one of their aisles. It was kind of dark because it was real— really early in the morning, probably was more like 7:00, right shortly after they opened. Anyway, they had their pallets just stacked in the aisles like I'm sure you maybe you've seen, they have stuff sitting in the aisle there. Well, I had— I was going around one, I had a friend that she had already gone around it, and when I ran around it, there was a— happened to be one of those nylon straps that they strap things down with. It was sticking out from under the pallet and I didn't see it and it caught— my foot caught in it and I took a pretty hard tumble. And uh ended up hurting my shoul— my right shoulder. I've got a tear in my rotator cuff and the MRI showed two other tears as well, so—
[03:01] [Receptionist]: So you have a total of three tears?
[03:04] [Randy Barger]: Yes.
[03:05] [Receptionist]: And it's all in the rotator cuff?
[03:07] [Randy Barger]: Uh, well one of them's in my rotator cuff and the uh other two are down a little bit lower like in my shoulder area. It said something— it had something to do with my bicep. Uh, I fell pretty— pretty good ways and and pretty hard right on the concrete floor.
[03:28] [Receptionist]: Okay. Goodness.
[03:31] [Randy Barger]: Cut my hands all up, uh things like that. I wish we'd have taken pictures, but we forgot to do that.
[03:41] [Receptionist]: Oh, so you don't have photos?
[03:43] [Randy Barger]: No, I didn't. But Home Depot is admitting fault about it. We had a witness, actually one of their employees saw it all happen. So and she— I think it's documented with maybe a statement from her. I know her name is Cat or Kathy, but I think she goes by Cat. And uh I don't have a last name.
[04:11] [Receptionist]: Okay, no worries. Okay, and as far as you um telling me that they are admitting— they're taking fault for this, um has their insurance company reached out to you? Have you um spoken with Home Depot about— can you kind of let me know um the status of that?
[04:31] [Randy Barger]: Yes. Uh, they— the— a firm called Sedgwick, uh-huh, they handle all of their settlement claims. And that's who I've been talking with. And uh they're— they're— I think— I feel now they're giving me the runaround and uh I was told some things that weren't true. We were— I was trying to settle it like that just between me and them. And now they're telling me that there was never a settlement agreed on or anything like there's nothing documented whatsoever. And that's— that— I don't know if she did or she didn't, but but the discussions did happen.
[05:17] [Receptionist]: Okay. And did they make you an offer already?
[05:19] [Randy Barger]: We— yeah, we had tentatively— the figure 23,000 had come up. And uh we had verbally agreed. She was supposed to send me paperwork over— over the internet to DocuSign and uh she said, "I'll have you a check out tomorrow." Well, that never happened. And then found out as of today, I don't know when it happened, but that lady that I was talking to, her name was Kristen, she's no longer with the company. So I don't know what happened, but now the people that that are handling it are trying to get— put in somebody else's hands to handle, they're telling me that those— that those conversations never happened, that they're not documented anywhere, and that's not true. I mean, they— I understand that they record those calls and uh they're definitely on there. I mean, we— her and I discussed it at length uh what hap— about it all and we kind of went back and forth on the amount and now they're denying it. Or and and then also, there's a— there's going to be a medical lien uh against it with the uh with uh Medicare. I have Humana Medicare and they've— they've got a lien on it to get their money back, which I don't— I don't have a lot of medical, but they— now what was being told me— told to me was the 23,000 was coming to me, full amount, and anything above that, the lien was— they was going to be separate. She— that's in the conversation. And now the lady is denying that and uh so I— I don't know where I stand now. Uh, I was expecting this to be over anytime, but now with what she's saying, all bets are off. You know, so I don't have an agree— I don't have an agreement apparently with them now.
[07:23] [Receptionist]: Okay. And can you kind of walk me through what you did for— for treatment? Um, starting off with um, you know, did the ambulance come get you at Home Depot? Did you go get checked out on your own?
[07:33] [Randy Barger]: No. Yeah, I went and got checked out on my own. I waited— I was out of town uh when it happened in Cedar Park and I I waited till I got home back here in Mount Pleasant to go see— I went to immediate care. They X-rayed it, of course they found it was inconclusive what they found, so I ended up having to go to a specialist, the orthopedics doctor, and had an MRI done. And of course the doctor's trying to say that that it can be taken care of with with therapy, but therapy is not working. You know, he said— he said as a last resort we'd we could address surgery. So I think it's coming down to surgery because I still have a problem with my right shoulder. Uh, it's not— it's not any better. I mean, it's better as far as movement, but I still have pain in my shoulder. Uh, you know, it's from— it's from this apparently from this rotator— anytime I start moving, I can't— I can't— it's hard for me to drive, putting my arm— any putting my arm up, you know, to prop it up on the steering wheel, it's hard. Uh, even— even hanging down the side— by my side, it hurts. So it's just constantly aches and and all, so uh you know, the mo— the movement had nothing to do with it. He tried to say it was froze up, but it's— that's not it. There's— obviously they found a tear, so there's a tear in there that needs to be addressed.
[09:05] [Receptionist]: Right. And how long would you say you've been in physical therapy for?
[09:09] [Randy Barger]: Well, I went through— I went through five rounds of physical therapy. I went back to see the doctor and he again told me, "Well, you need to keep going to therapy. I want you to go through more therapy." But the thing is, I'm on a fixed income and the co-pay to go— to go to therapy every time, he wanted me to go through six more sessions and and it's $25 a time whenever I go for my co-pay. I— with my income, I can't afford that. I mean, because we're ended up it's, you know, between $100 and $200 there out of my income that I can't spare.
[09:50] [Receptionist]: Right. Yes sir.
[09:52] [Randy Barger]: And uh so I— I haven't been going this last little bit and I can start going back again if I need to. Uh, I need to go see the doctor again. I missed a— I missed an appointment because of the weather, so—
[10:06] [Receptionist]: Okay. And so um you've been treating consistently since June or have you taken some time off in between? Um, when's the last time you think you went to therapy?
[10:17] [Randy Barger]: I had— the doctor didn't— the doctor didn't put me through therapy until this past fall. He, you know, finally got to see— it took— it took forever to get— get uh to see a specialist because of my insurance getting approvals and all that, you know, referrals, getting that done. I don't know why it took so long, but it took a while to even get to see the doctor. So I started therapy right after I started seeing him, which was in the fall.
[10:47] [Receptionist]: Okay. And when would you say the last time you went to therapy was?
[10:52] [Randy Barger]: It was about a month ago.
[10:54] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[10:57] [Randy Barger]: At Titus Regional.
[11:01] [Receptionist]: Titus Regional, okay. Let's see here.

[ ... Silence (11s) ... ]

[11:15] [Randy Barger]: I mean, I just— I don't know what to do, you know, in with all this. I don't know what to do next because I was expecting this to be over with and they'd be sending me a check, but now that's apparently not what's going to happen.
[11:29] [Receptionist]: Okay. And was it all your doctors that you've been seeing at Titus Regional as well?
[11:35] [Randy Barger]: No, the doctor uh was uh was Dr. Jones and he is with Azalea Medical Group, which they— they have a— they see patients in Mount Pleasant as well, but I was having to go to Tyler for his main office is to see him.
[11:51] [Receptionist]: Okay, yeah, I'm familiar with Azalea. Um, I've— I've had some— I had actually broken my arm not long ago and I went there as well um to see a doctor there in Tyler. Yeah. Okay. Um, and so let me ask you this, just a few more questions. Um, has Home Depot released any video footage or anything like that to you?
[12:15] [Randy Barger]: No. I haven't— I haven't heard anything about— all they did was admit to fault.
[12:21] [Receptionist]: Okay. And do you have any documents from them admitting to fault?
[12:25] [Randy Barger]: No. It was all with— it was all with uh this from Sedgwick.
[12:31] [Receptionist]: Sedgwick, okay. So all communication was through them?
[12:34] [Randy Barger]: Yeah.
[12:35] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[12:40] [Receptionist]: All right. Give me just a moment, I'm going to put you on a brief hold. I'm going to let one of our attorneys here um kind of review this um and see if it's something we can assist you with. Um, so give me just a moment to put you on a hold, okay?
[12:53] [Randy Barger]: Okay.
[12:54] [Receptionist]: Yeah, give me just a second. Thank you.
[12:58] [Receptionist]: You still there, Randy?
[13:01] [Randy Barger]: Yes ma'am.
[13:02] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me ask you this because this is just going to be one of the things we're going to have to get around. Do you have any of the email threads or any communication with Sedgwick um whether that was through text message or email or was everything just the phone call?
[13:20] [Randy Barger]: Everything was pretty much over the phone. Uh, let me see, I'll have to look. I might have got something in email, but uh if— that's been a while back. I don't know for— I can't remember for sure. You know, honestly, I didn't keep up with a lot of that because I thought it was being handled, you know, fine, you know, and I wasn't going to have to get to this point. So I thought— I just thought it, you know, was— was resolved by me just handling it, but uh apparently not. I mean, I don't know what their problem is now, so—
[13:56] [Receptionist]: Right. Okay. Well, um will you go ahead and look through that, see if you can find any of those emails or um any of the documentation you have um for me and either give me a call back this evening or um I can reach out to you in the morning, check back up?
[14:15] [Randy Barger]: Okay. Uh, why don't you call me if you don't mind? I tend to forget.
[14:20] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[14:21] [Randy Barger]: So—
[14:21] [Receptionist]: Okay, that's totally fine. What—
[14:23] [Randy Barger]: I'm sorry, what law group is this? I've called so many now and I've lost my place on my phone, so I can't remember who I called.
[14:30] [Receptionist]: No worries. This is McCraw again.
[14:33] [Randy Barger]: Okay, that's what I've got here, I wasn't sure. So okay.
[14:37] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Yeah, no worries. So what I'm going to do in the meantime, um we I'm just um something, you know, we we can't hop on too fast is we kind of want to see what um Sedgwick has mentioned to you uh as far as communication. If we can kind of get an idea of that, um we can, you know, that'll help us moving forward and seeing what we can do or where to take off from. I'm also going to speak with some of our other attorneys here um and let them know just in case, you know, you don't have that communication of what we could potentially do. But just to be safe, we want to know kind of what has been communicated if there's anything in documents that you might find.
[15:17] [Randy Barger]: Okay. I'll look and see what I can find. I was bad about not keeping up with them, I'm just telling you up front. I I don't know if I can put my hands on— as far— the quickest thing maybe email if I've got something, so but I can check that real quick.
[15:35] [Receptionist]: Okay. Well, look through your email. Um, if you can find anything, you know, screenshot it, um whatever you can do. I'll reach back out to you first thing in the morning and kind of follow up and see what you might have found. Um, and I might have an answer for you better of what we can do to help you out moving forward, okay?
[15:51] [Randy Barger]: Okay.
[15:52] [Receptionist]: Okay, awesome. I will speak with you in the morning, Randy.
[15:57] [Randy Barger]: All right. Thank you so much.
[15:59] [Receptionist]: Yeah, thank you. Bye-bye.
[16:01] [Randy Barger]: Bye-bye.
