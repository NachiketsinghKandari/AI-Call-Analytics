[00:00] [Unknown]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: Coker Law Group, this is Maddie, how can I help you?
[00:08] [Dan Smith]: Hey, uh, good morning. This is Dan Smith. I was calling for Thompson Du. This is, um, involving a case that, uh, where he represents Jennifer Bernason.
[00:21] [Receptionist]: One second. And...
[00:25] [Dan Smith]: Oh, go ahead.
[00:26] [Receptionist]: I was just...
[00:27] [Dan Smith]: I was just going to say, I'm also an attorney in in that case.
[00:31] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay. And that was Jennifer Bernason?
[00:38] [Dan Smith]: Yes.
[00:40] [Receptionist]: Okay. Would you mind just, um, holding on the line for me and I will reach out to Thompson and, um, just to confirm you are opposing counsel?

[01:23] [Receptionist]: What would be a good callback number?
[01:25] [Dan Smith]: 817-822-0005.

[01:39] [Receptionist]: Thank you. Have a great day. Bye-bye.
