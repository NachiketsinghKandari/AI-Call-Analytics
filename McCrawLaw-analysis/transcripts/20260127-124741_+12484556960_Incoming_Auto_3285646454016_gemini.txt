----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 3]: This call is being recorded.
[00:05] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Kimberly, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Betsy]: Hey Kimberly, it's Betsy at Salesforce. How are you?
[00:10] [Receptionist]: I'm good, how are you doing?
[00:12] [Betsy]: Good. I just wanted to check in with you guys. I know Janet was out of town and said, said that we could regroup this week and I had a couple of times that are available with one of our partners that you guys wanted to meet with. So I wanted to send that over and see if you guys have availability either tomorrow or Thursday to regroup.
[00:30] [Receptionist]: I see. Um, let me see here. Janet, unfortunately, um, I know that she is kind of leading this project and she unfortunately got stuck. We are in Texas and in, in the ice storm. So she got stuck out of town and unfortunately won't be able to return until Friday, um, or so. Um, and then, let's see...
[00:59] [Betsy]: Oh no, I'm so sorry. I know, I feel like the whole country got hit. We're in Chicago, so we're like kind of used to it, but I feel like everyone else shuts down. Like so many of my friends in the South had snow and like couldn't go outside.
[01:14] [Receptionist]: Yeah, and we're actually, yeah, so she got, uh, stuck out, out of town, um, and she won't be on a flight back until Friday. And then we're actually out of the office due to the weather. Um, I believe we won't be back in the office until Thursday, it's looking like. Um, so we're all kind of just remote right now as well.
[01:35] [Betsy]: Would you guys be able to join a call with a partner remote if we, if everybody dialed in? The only reason I'm asking is because our, our year end ends on the 31st, so, and I know that you guys were interested in taking advantage of the discount, which was much larger at the end of the year. So that's why we're kind of hustling to pull something together, um, if it's possible, because I'd rather give you guys the best price and prices go, you know, up after Jan 1 and the year resets.
[02:05] [Receptionist]: Yeah. No, I understand. Let me, let me place you on a brief hold here, Betsy. Let me see what Zade's calendar is looking like.
[02:16] [Betsy]: Okay. The times that I have open, if you want to check, are, um, 10:00 to 12:00 tomorrow. That's Cen— you guys are Central too, correct?
[02:26] [Receptionist]: Correct.
[02:27] [Betsy]: Yeah. Um, and then 11:00 to 1:00 on Thursday. And if those don't work and you see any other openings, just let me know and we can probably make it work.
[02:36] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me just one moment. I'll place you on a brief hold here and let me check Zade's availability. Mm-hmm.
[02:48] [Receptionist]: Hey Betsy, I'm sorry for that hold there.
[02:51] [Betsy]: No worries. Learning all about customer testimonials there.
[02:56] [Receptionist]: Um, I was able to check in with Zade. Um, he let me know that, yeah, since Janet won't be back until Friday or even next week or so, he thinks it would be best, and I also agree, I think it would be best to set up a meeting for maybe next week, if that's possible. I know that your end is coming up for you guys, but we just want to make sure, um, we take our time with the decision and are able to meet with, um, the partners, um, beforehand. So I think, you know, even if prices go up, I think we're, you know, we're just gonna have to roll with that and make the decision, um, with enough time. So maybe sometime next week would work for you guys?
[03:38] [Betsy]: Yeah, totally. What, um, that's totally fine. I just obviously want to be transparent on like how we can make the, you know, the best deal for you guys, um, because I know this is a priority and I know that the smart, um, advocate integration is kind of a huge pain for you right now. So, um, but yeah, we can move it at whatever pace you guys, you guys need or, you know, whatever the partners are looking for. What works next week for you guys?
[03:59] [Receptionist]: Let me pull that up here. Just one moment. So it looks like next week we are pretty open, um, Wednesday, Thursday, myself and Janet. And then if you're able to send the invite, I don't have access to Zade's, um, calendar, but he should be able to join.
[04:26] [Betsy]: Okay. So Wednesday the 4th or Thursday the 5th. Do you have a preference? Like, what about 10:00 AM on Wednesday? Would that work?
[04:34] [Receptionist]: That would actually work. I think Monday works perfect. I mean, sorry, 10:00 AM morning works perfect.
[04:41] [Betsy]: Yeah, on, on February 4th.
[04:43] [Receptionist]: Yes. Let me...
[04:44] [Betsy]: Okay. I'm going to, I'll send you an invite. I'm going to, um, check with one— I know you guys wanted to meet with both partners, so I'll ping the partner and make sure that they're also available for that. And then once I have confirmation, um, is there a second slot available that you want to give me as a backup? Because I can propose that to, to the other partner and that way, I don't know if it'd be easier just meeting with, like, both partners in one day, um, so we could get that out of the way for you and, I don't know, the way my brain works, it's like easier, you have both options, they're fresh in your mind.
[05:13] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Um, let me see. I mean, we're pretty open on, on Wednesday or Thursday.
[05:23] [Betsy]: Okay. Um, let me see a couple options. How about, um, let me just looking here really quick. What about like, um, 11— uh, let's see, 11:00 on Wednesday the 4th for option two?
[05:41] [Receptionist]: Yeah, 10:00 or 11:00.
[05:42] [Betsy]: Okay. So I'll try to get them on— and they'd just be like quick 30 minutes, it'd probably be less. Um, but I will, I will follow up and you guys are all on that thread once I have confirmation and we can go from there. But, um, yeah, just if, you know, anything changes, I just want to make sure that we were upfront with you guys on, on the pricing and how it will be different, you know, starting next week.
[06:05] [Receptionist]: Yeah, no, and I, yeah, I think we totally understand that. We just want to make sure we're, um, taking our time with the decision as well.
[06:12] [Betsy]: Totally. Totally, totally. Okay, we'll move it whatever pace works for you guys, um, and we'll get the next call set up, you guys can meet with the partners, review, and then we'll go from there.
[06:22] [Receptionist]: Okay, perfect.
[06:23] [Betsy]: All right, Kimberly, it's nice talking to you. Stay warm and we'll talk soon.
[06:27] [Receptionist]: You too. Stay safe.
[06:28] [Betsy]: Okay, thanks so much. Bye.
[06:30] [Receptionist]: Bye-bye.
