[00:00] [Unknown]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, this is Jessica, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Brianna]: Hello, Jessica, this is Brianna calling from Texas Functional Health Centers.
[00:12] [Receptionist]: Hi, yeah, how can I help you?
[00:17] [Brianna]: Yes, we have—is this the attorney's office?
[00:21] [Receptionist]: Yes, this is the McCraw Law Group.
[00:23] [Brianna]: Okay. Yes, I have a patient here, um, Kim Williams. She is on a case with y'all. We had appointments set for her January 9th of 2026 and also, uh, January 27th of 2026. She has cancelled both of those appointments. I'm just wondering if I could get a update on if she's still continuing that case with y'all.
[00:50] [Receptionist]: Okay, yeah, I can definitely connect you over, um, to the case manager. Can I get where you're calling from one more time? You said Texas Functional Health Centers?
[00:59] [Brianna]: Yes, ma'am.
[01:01] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me go ahead and get you connected over.
[01:04] [Brianna]: All right, thank you.
[01:05] [Receptionist]: Mhm.
[01:10] [Receptionist]: I'm so sorry for that hold there. It does look like, uh, her case manager is currently unavailable, but I will go ahead and send her a high-priority message that way she knows that you guys were having issues, um, with the client, um, going to her appointments, and she should be reaching out as soon as possible. Can I get a good callback number for you?
[01:28] [Brianna]: Yes, it'd be 469-334-0624.
[01:38] [Receptionist]: 0624. All right, perfect. I'll go ahead and get this sent over, she should be reaching out. You have a nice day.
[01:42] [Brianna]: Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.
[01:44] [Receptionist]: Mhm.
