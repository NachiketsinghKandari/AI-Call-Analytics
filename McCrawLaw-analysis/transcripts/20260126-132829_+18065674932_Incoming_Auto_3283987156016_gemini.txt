[ ... Silence (7s) ... ]
[00:12] [Unknown]: Hey, now it's a little bit small for my taste. Is that okay with you?
[00:15] [Receptionist]: Hello, Bey and Associates, this is Stephen speaking, how may I help you today?
[00:19] [Aja Sutton]: Hi Stephen, um, my name is Aja Sutton and I do have a case open with y'all, but I just had a quick question.
[00:27] [Receptionist]: Alright, um, let me go ahead, would you be able to spell your first name for me?
[00:34] [Aja Sutton]: A-J-A.
[00:37] [Receptionist]: And then Sutton, you said S-U-T-T-O-N?
[00:41] [Aja Sutton]: Yes sir.
[00:43] [Receptionist]: Alright, and then just in case we disconnect, is the best number for you where you're calling from at 806-567-4932?
[00:51] [Aja Sutton]: Yes sir.
[00:54] [Receptionist]: Alright, let me go ahead, and what, and what question did you have?
[00:59] [Aja Sutton]: Um, okay, so I had took up on some counseling on my own and, um, I guess my caseworker had reached out to my current counselor, but since, um, she couldn't do like the letter of protection or whatever, she had sent me, um, another counselor. But even, so even with them reaching out to my current counselor that I was, that I was paying out of pocket for, do I still need to go ahead and start counseling with the counselor that they reached out, like, for? Yeah. Does that make sense? Um...
[01:36] [Receptionist]: No worries. And what I'll be doing is sending a message over to the team, um, to see if we can get an answer on that. Um, so I'll get them a message and they'll call back as soon as possible. I'll just make sure I have it worded right. So you have, you already had one that you're paying out of pocket for, but they sent you another one and you wanted to know if you had to go to the one they referred you to?
[01:58] [Aja Sutton]: Well, I, I don't, like, I don't mind, but they had also, um, basically yes, because they had also reached out to my counselor that I'm seeing right now and, um, so I didn't know if that worked out or if I still need to, yeah, to the one that they referred me to.
[02:17] [Receptionist]: Referred to her or she can continue. There we go. I have that all typed up. I'll go ahead and send that and request a follow-up for them to get that answered for you or cleared up for you.
[02:39] [Aja Sutton]: Okay, thank you so much.
[02:42] [Receptionist]: Thank you as well, and take care and have a good rest of your day.
[02:45] [Aja Sutton]: You as well, bye-bye.
[02:48] [Receptionist]: Thank you, bye.
