[ ... Silence (11s) ... ]

[02:24] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: Hi, how are we doing? Cash or credit?
[02:28] [Speaker 5]: I actually have cash.
[02:29] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: All right. Your total's 88. What's six weeks from today? Oh, okay. Six weeks, let's see, today is the 28th... one, two, three, four, five, six, the 11th. Do you want to do a Wednesday or Tuesday?
[02:46] [Speaker 5]: I'm indifferent, whatever works for you.
[02:48] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: Okay, so that is the 11th of— hold on— March. So sorry. Okay, I got it. Let me get your change. Oh, thank you! I'm gonna let her on out, Mom. Okay, I'm so sorry. Um, what was the next question? I'm sorry.
[03:12] [Receptionist]: Um, so can you tell me uh a little bit about the details of what you're looking for help with specifically?
[03:18] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: Yes. So I gotta walk outside so she doesn't hear me because she's walking out. Thank you, you have a blessed one and we'll see you next time! Bye, thank you! So, um, I am married to someone who is incarcerated, um, and owns property in Mexico and also um is inheriting property from his parents. And um one of his sisters right now is their caregiver and has— takes care of them, but one of the brothers is reaching out to me because he's finding out that she's trying to change all the property that they have a will for that's left to them into her name. And I just found out she's trying to change some of his properties into her name, my husband's properties. I do have power of attorney over him, I established that while he was incarcerated. He has a life sentence so he's not getting out. Um, and I am wanting to see what I can do. I need to sell the properties or I need to make sure she's unable to sell the properties that are legally mine and his son's.
[04:55] [Receptionist]: Okay, so um that's going to be not something that we can help with, but I do have a referral for someone who may be able to assist. Um, they definitely do like probate type matters. Um, for the service area I'm not a hundred percent sure, but uh I would try Mark McCraw. I can— that's Mark McCraw PC and his phone number is 972-562-6262.
[05:27] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: 6262. So are— would y'all be able, let's say I wanted to sell a property in Mexico, do y'all do that kind of— do y'all handle stuff like that?
[05:36] [Receptionist]: Uh, we do not. Um, we don't do any kind of real estate stuff specifically. Um, for— for that, uh I would say maybe try the state bar and see if they know anyone, but you may need someone uh who is specifically in Mexico for that.
[05:51] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: Okay. Yeah, because Mexico's tricky, I know there you have enough money you can pretty much change anything and do anything. So, um, okay, I'm gonna try Mark. I appreciate you.
[06:03] [Receptionist]: Absolutely, thank you and you have a good one.
[06:06] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: Thank you, thank you. Uh-huh, bye-bye.
[06:08] [Receptionist]: Uh-huh, bye.
