[00:42] [Receptionist]: Because of the weather?
[00:44] [Lou]: Oh, yeah.

[01:12] [Lou]: Oh, boy.
[01:13] [Receptionist]: Yeah, we were— I was— I was stuck at home for three days. And finally came back.
[01:21] [Lou]: Yeah, people don't understand that, you know, I've lived in Montana, Maryland, Washington State, so I know snow. And my wife loves Tennessee, she wants to move there and I'm like, "Nope."
[01:33] [Receptionist]: You're like, "Not today."
[01:35] [Lou]: Yeah. Or Kentucky for that matter.
[01:40] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Okay, Athena Mack. And may I tell them what this is regarding?
[01:45] [Lou]: Yeah, I just spoke with Athena again, and she said you guys represent her, but we've never received a letter of representation.
[01:56] [Receptionist]: Okay, letter of rep. Okay, let me put you on hold for a moment, okay?
[02:02] [Lou]: All right, thank you.
