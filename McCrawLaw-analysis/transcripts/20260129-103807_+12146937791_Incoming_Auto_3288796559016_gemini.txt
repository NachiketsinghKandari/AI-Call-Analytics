----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded.
[00:03] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, this is Tarrica speaking, how may I help you today?
[00:07] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Uh, yes, I was trying to get a hold of Mary Thomas.
[00:10] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay. May I get your first and last name?
[00:14] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Uh, Vrdie, V as in Victor, R-D-I-E, Marie Turner, T-U-R-N-E-R.
[00:20] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. Give me one moment, please.
[00:22] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Okay.
[00:25] [Receptionist]: I'm sorry about that long hold there. It does seem that Mary is currently unavailable, but I could forward a message over for her and make sure that she has a good callback number so that she can get back to you.
[00:39] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, uh, we've been having phone problems, I hadn't been getting all my emails and stuff. And, uh, I know she wanted some information and, uh, I was gonna try to do it all at one time or I can come up there as soon as the streets thaw out to the office in Wylie. Uh, I know she wanted a copy of the insurance, Medicare and Blue Cross and my, uh, I think she asked for my driver's license, I'm not gonna swear on that right now, I'm not looking at the email. And I know she wanted a contact, last one I had was for, uh, Laurel Jones and I don't know if she can get a hold of them or not, but I want to give her all that information, but I'm not gonna send all my, uh, cards and stuff going back and forth.
[01:30] [Receptionist]: So y'all been having, um, you've been having issues with, um, your emails?
[01:38] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Uh, yeah, I got it back up finally yesterday and, uh, Saturday we're gonna switch carriers, so I don't know what's gonna happen after that. Hopefully nothing.
[01:49] [Receptionist]: I can make sure that she knows that you've been trying to, um, get your email, I mean, your information sent over to her and getting in, get into contact with her and I will make sure that this is forwarded to her so that she can reach out to you as soon as she's, um, available.
[02:06] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, I know it's kind of hard with, uh, these phone numbers, the main one going to everybody, 'cause I don't have a, a separate number that would go direct to her. I don't know if she has an extension or whatever.
[02:22] [Receptionist]: You said you do have her, um, direct email though, right? To when you've, um, been getting in communication with her?
[02:32] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Well, when she sends it, I try to, uh, answer about then, but I got one M Thomas at McCraw Law Group dot com, I think, yeah.
[02:45] [Receptionist]: Yes, yes.
[02:48] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: But, uh, I know I have her in there as a contact, so I don't know how that would go with that phone number. Anyways, uh, but it's still ice out here on our driveway and stuff and the street was still frozen over 'cause it freezes back at night too and it's never really thawed out. But I know that y'all got an office right there in Wylie that I can bring what she needs all in one visit as soon as I can.
[03:30] [Receptionist]: Let me see. Um...
[03:34] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: And I don't know though if anybody's been there or not since last Friday a week ago.
[03:41] [Receptionist]: And you said, um, the Wylie location, you don't know if they're open?
[03:45] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: I don't know if they're open or not.
[03:47] [Receptionist]: Gotcha.
[03:48] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Because this is the only number I have and when I dialed it, you answered, and I don't know where you're at, so.
[03:54] [Receptionist]: Gotcha.
[03:55] [ ... Silence (16s) ... ]
[04:11] [Receptionist]: I'm just making sure I'm getting all of this down for Mary.
[04:15] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, 'cause and I, I only got that information about the, uh, MRI they want me have late yesterday afternoon, so no, I have not contacted my doctor and how soon he gets back with me, you know, is another question too.
[04:33] [Receptionist]: Gotcha.
[04:40] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: I'm sorry, what was your name again?
[04:42] [Receptionist]: Tarrica.
[04:43] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: I'm sorry, what?
[04:44] [Receptionist]: Tarrica.
[04:46] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Tarrica?
[04:47] [Receptionist]: Yes, yes.
[04:48] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: How do you spell that? T-E...
[04:51] [Receptionist]: Um, two R's, I-C-A.
[04:56] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Okay, that's unusual. Pretty.
[05:01] [Receptionist]: Thank you.
[05:03] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Well, mine's unusual too, so that's why I don't use my first name.
[05:07] [Receptionist]: Yeah, it's definitely, I've gotten that before. It's definitely unique.
[05:12] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: I know everybody says, "That's pretty." I said, "Not if you got teased by it when you were a child." Even though it starts with a V, they always pronounce it with a B.
[05:25] [Receptionist]: Let's see. Okay, I got all of this down. Um, is there anything else that you would like me to let her know?
[05:35] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Uh, I don't know, I know she wanted to contact that I had and I'm not sure if she's still there or not because, uh, I had a conference call set up with her two or three times and twice she failed to answer me and then I got a text that went to somebody named Boyd. I don't know who it was 'cause I kept looking for it and it disappeared and I even went to the trash and I couldn't find it.
[06:06] [Receptionist]: So you're also having issues with, um, your number with Mary being able to contact the right number?
[06:14] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: With my phone number?
[06:16] [Receptionist]: Mhm.
[06:17] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: No, I'm not having any problems right now. Not that she calls. Uh, I make no bets on anything else. Because I think that email's working right now.
[06:30] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[06:31] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Because I'm seeing a lot of stuff coming through, so.
[06:36] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[06:37] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: All right, and if she calls me, I can give her some of the information she wants. Uh, I don't particularly want my insurance and driver's license going through a line that's going to everybody, which I don't know how well protected it is, you know, you understand what I'm saying?
[06:58] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. I, I see, I understand.
[07:04] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Okay.
[07:05] [Receptionist]: Okay, great. I have all of this down for her. I'm going to make sure that I forward this message to her. I'm going to also leave your number on this message and then she should be reaching out to you as soon as she's, um, available. I saw that she, um, left a voicemail for you yesterday.
[07:23] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, I got that late yesterday afternoon.
[07:25] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. So I am going to make sure that she sees this and knows that you called back, leave behind the information and, um, she should be reaching out to you when she's available.
[07:37] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, like I said, Saturday we get new carrier and I don't know, I hopefully there's no problem switching over, but you never know.
[07:48] [Receptionist]: Yeah. I, Mary should be able to answer all of those, um, questions too when she, um, is available. She'll be able to answer that, that type of stuff.
[08:00] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Okay. Uh, does she stay in the office in Wylie all the time or she, I know y'all got one in McKinney, I don't know how she plays around, you know what I mean? She might be, she might be in McKinney, if she's smart she would be.
[08:16] [Receptionist]: I'm actually, I'm not quite sure. I, um, could ask her and check in to see if she's been, um, to the Wylie location frequently, but...
[08:31] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, uh, I sent a, a message from her text that said call me, but, uh, you know, where I did that right, I don't know. I'm half, half asleep and half awake, so.
[08:45] [Receptionist]: Understandable, it's been a long week.
[08:48] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Oh, it has, like, it's been a month almost, seems like. Then we're gonna get hit with another one coming in, I think Saturday too. Hopefully if there's no rain or anything, we'll be okay.
[09:04] [Receptionist]: You know, I'm glad to definitely see the weather's turning up. All right, I have all of your information. Is there anything else that you would like me to...
[09:14] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: No, I just need know what she wants, uh, you know, I've got Laurel Jones, that's the only contact that I have, the last one that I had. And like I said, they sent me something with a Boy— Boyd, I think it was B-O-Y-D, I'm not sure. I don't even know what the first name was 'cause it just, you know, I was trying to look at it real fast and, like I said, when I went back, it disappeared and it wasn't in trash either, so I don't know what happened with that person.
[09:47] [Receptionist]: Hmm, that's unusual.
[09:52] [Receptionist]: Okay, I have all this down. Um, okay, so that, this should be good. I'll make sure that this message gets forwarded over to her and that should be, yeah, that should be all. I hope you have an amazing day and thanks for calling.
[10:11] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Me too.
[10:12] [Receptionist]: And you too. And I will make sure that she knows that you have called back and have all this information attached to it.
[10:21] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Okay. I appreciate it.
[10:23] [Receptionist]: Of course, of course.
[10:24] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Thank you too. You have a great one. Bye-bye.
[10:27] [Receptionist]: Bye.
