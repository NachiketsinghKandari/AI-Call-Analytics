[00:00] [Unknown]: This call is being recorded.
[00:05] [Miha]: Hi Ms. Maria.
[00:06] [Maria]: Morning Miha, you have a moment?
[00:09] [Miha]: Yes, I can help.
[00:11] [Maria]: Okay, so I'm speaking to Adrian Castle and I'm trying to get him to understand that we still can't take it because the incident happened at his house, right?
[00:21] [Miha]: Oh, I see. Mm-hm.
[00:23] [Maria]: And it, uh, the homeowners, it happened at that house, but he's talking about that they have homeowners on another house. So we still can't take it, correct?
[00:36] [Miha]: Um, I think— I'm not too sure, that's why I said in the email that it might be best if an attorney would review if we would be able to even take that on because he's talking about they have another property that has homeowners insurance, is that correct?
[00:55] [Maria]: Correct.
[00:56] [Miha]: Yeah, I'm not too sure there. I still don't think it would be wanted because if that was the case that that they could recover from that other property, then his other attorney would have done it. You know what I mean?
[01:13] [Maria]: Yes. Yes, I'm trying to get him to—
[01:15] [Miha]: So I just still don't— I still don't think it's wanted because of that situation. Um, and he had another attorney on it, I I don't know, we would have to get a withdrawal letter if it if it was wanted. We don't even have photographs of his bite to see if even just alone his bite alone is something that we would want. We don't even know if it's a serious bite or the injuries. Um, so to me, it's just still not wanted because his other attorney would would have took it— kept it if if it was possible to recover from that other property that he's saying.
[01:55] [Maria]: Correct. Okay, let me try one more time.
[01:58] [Miha]: But if he's not taking— but if he's not taking the rejection from you, if he's like adamant in not taking it, I would just tell him, um, let me, uh, let an attorney know what's going on and we'll give you a call back and then we can give him a another call back. And I would see if maybe if you tell Todd what's going on, like, hey, he thinks there's another property to recover from. I think it's still going to be a reject, but just so an attorney says so and then we can tell him per our attorneys.
[02:26] [Maria]: Yes, I know. Okay.
[02:27] [Miha]: Yeah.
[02:29] [Maria]: Okay, I'll try it again. Appreciate you, Miha.
[02:32] [Miha]: Oh, alright. Thank you.
[02:34] [Maria]: Thank you. Bye.
[02:36] [Miha]: Bye.
