----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Automated Voice]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Gladita, how can I help you?
[00:08] [Lisa]: Hi, this is Lisa from State Farm Insurance. I was calling to touch base on a client, Ashley Rogers, for I think a dog bite incident.
[00:18] [Receptionist]: One second. Ashley... let me just pull up that case.
[00:25] [Lisa]: Sure.
[00:27] [ ... Silence (31s) ... ]
[00:58] [Receptionist]: I am so sorry that it's taking more than usual. Um, our system is currently down, I believe, so...
[01:08] [Lisa]: That's okay.
[01:09] [Receptionist]: ...and I'm not quite sure who's handling that case, so...
[01:14] [Lisa]: Okay.
[01:15] [Receptionist]: Would you mind just holding just a second for me?
[01:18] [Lisa]: Yeah, that's fine. Thanks.
[01:20] [Receptionist]: Thank you.
[01:21] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[01:30] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for holding, Lisa. So, um, our system is currently down, so I can't seem to see who the case manager or the attorney is assigned to that case. I don't know if you would mind calling back later?
[01:45] [Lisa]: Okay, that's fine. I appreciate it.
[01:48] [Receptionist]: Or if you leave me a good callback number, I can go ahead and request that callback once our system is back.
[01:56] [Lisa]: Sure. It's, um, 844-458-4300.
[02:04] [Receptionist]: 4300. Okay. Thank you so much. I will make sure for them to give you a callback, okay? Thank you.
[02:11] [Lisa]: Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.
[02:13] [Receptionist]: Bye-bye.
