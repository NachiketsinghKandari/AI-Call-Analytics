[05:40] [JD]: Um, not necessarily. Um, it was something that was ordered a— I'm assuming a couple weeks ago. So it's not like urgent, but it is something I think the patient was, uh, wanting to start to do to to begin.
[05:54] [Receptionist]: Okay. All right. That sounds good. I just wanted to clarify what the status would be. So, all right. I'm going to go ahead and get this over to the team right away and, uh, that way they can review it for you, okay?
