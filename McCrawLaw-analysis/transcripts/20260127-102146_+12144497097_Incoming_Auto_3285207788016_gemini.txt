----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 3]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, this is Tareka speaking, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Kim]: Hey Tareka, it's Kim. Um, I am just call testing. I think Zade was just able to fix our phones.
[00:13] [Receptionist]: Oh, slay. Thank you. Awesome. All right, so it worked, call came through and everything?
[00:18] [Kim]: Yep.
[00:19] [Receptionist]: All right, cool. Thank you. I guess Zade had the power to do it, um, online this entire time. But yesterday I asked him, I'm like, "Hey, let me know if you're in the office, I need help with the phones," and he, like, didn't tell me anything until today. He's like, "Oh, actually I can help." Like, "Oop, that would've— that would've been great to know yesterday." That's nice to know. All right, well, um, all right, let— since they are working, let me know if you need me for any calls. Gotcha. Um, and on that one that I, um, Eric Degler from Smith AI, since Smith AI rejected live on call, we don't have to send a, um, rejection message out. But if you could just update that lead on Salesforce to the rejected status and then it'll ask— ask for a reject reason and then reject description. And you can just say, you know, Smith AI rejected due to XYZ, outside of off— um, sorry, outside of practice area or rejected due to, you know, whatever the reason is.
[01:31] [Kim]: Gotcha.
[01:32] [Receptionist]: And then it'll ask you to fill in— fill in where they were referred out to and that's where you would add the Dallas Bar.
[01:42] [Kim]: Okay.
[01:45] [Receptionist]: And he will probably be sitting in the new column.
[01:49] [Kim]: I found him. Mm-hmm. Um, okay, so entry and I put in the description rejected due to inquiring outside of practice area.
[02:03] [Receptionist]: Yep. And then the reject status would be the same from the drop-down list.
[02:10] [Kim]: Mm-hmm. Yeah, got it.
[02:15] [Receptionist]: Awesome. And then the only other thing I would adjust on those leads, if you can see whenever it's integrated on its own, um, it has the contact method as basically it should be flip-flopped. The contact method should— should be after hours and the lead source should be Google search. So we have to go in and adjust that.
[02:37] [Kim]: [ ... Silence (11s) ... ] Google. Eh, there we go.
[02:48] [Receptionist]: And then while you're in that section, if you would be able to add a home office, since he did Google search Amarillo, his home office would be Amarillo. Or his closest location.
[03:01] [Kim]: So for, um, Google search Amarillo?
[03:06] [Receptionist]: Mm-hmm. Since he's in that area. Um, and also home office would be Amarillo.
[03:14] [Kim]: [ ... Silence (19s) ... ] Okay. Wait, is that, um, oh, is it asking for the home office, is that portion after you, um, mark the status?
[03:33] [Receptionist]: Um, yes. Well, no, not— it's right there underneath contact method. Lead, lead source, contact...
[03:49] [Kim]: [ ... Silence (22s) ... ] Um, let's see. I went under...
[04:11] [Receptionist]: Mm-hmm.
[04:12] [Kim]: For the rejection description, I went under it's like the contact information.
[04:18] [Receptionist]: Mm-hmm.
[04:19] [Kim]: Or no, sorry, syncing incident details is where I went for the rejected.
[04:25] [Receptionist]: Okay. So let's see. So the rejected, did you add your description?
[04:32] [Kim]: Yes.
[04:33] [Receptionist]: And then referred to Dallas Bar?
[04:37] [Kim]: Yep.
[04:38] [Receptionist]: Cool. And then right maybe two fields underneath that it says type of practice requested and then traffic tickets should be an option.
[04:52] [Kim]: [ ... Silence (6s) ... ] Wait, I wish I could show you my screen because I'm like...
[04:58] [Receptionist]: Yeah, we can— should I do a call? Let me— let me call you. Okay. Um, video call and then you should be able to share your screen. I'm gonna hang up here.
