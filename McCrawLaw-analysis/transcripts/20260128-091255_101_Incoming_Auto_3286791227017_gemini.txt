----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Automated Voice]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: Good morning.
[00:05] [Unknown]: Hey there, good morning. Um, I just saw your message back about Adrian Castle.
[00:11] [Receptionist]: Yes.
[00:12] [Unknown]: I know that Todd had said rejected and that's fine, I think it's a reject too, but since he called yesterday, do you mind giving him a call again? Because it looks like he called yesterday and saying that he knows that there was no homeowners insurance, but that he found out that the homeowners have another property that there could be insurance on. I honestly just don't think that we would be able to take that on right now and investigate that, especially if his old firm wasn't able to find that property and insurance on another one. I'm sure they would have ran investigations. Um, if you don't mind calling him again because he just called yesterday, just letting him know we received his message about the updates, just unfortunately at this time it's not something we're able to take on.
[00:57] [Receptionist]: Sounds good. I'll do it right now, Miha.
[01:00] [Unknown]: Okay.
[01:01] [Receptionist]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that, you cut out.
[01:03] [Unknown]: Okay.
[01:04] [Receptionist]: I'm gonna do that right now. Did you get my picture on your email to make sure my phone is set correctly?
[01:12] [Unknown]: I did, and it is correct. It looks like everyone's is correct. I'm not too sure what's happening, honestly. Um, so if they can't figure it out, I mean, I guess it's fine that they're just gonna have to go to the after-hours service and whatever we can catch, we can catch. But it's fine.
[01:33] [Receptionist]: Okay. Okay. Well, I'm here at work. I'm tired of staying home. I am tired.
[01:40] [Unknown]: I know, me too. I'd be at the office too if our roads— how are y'all's roads?
[01:45] [Receptionist]: They're good, they're good.
[01:46] [Unknown]: They're— oh, okay.
[01:47] [Receptionist]: Yeah, mhm. But I'm the type that, oh no, after one day, yo salgo corriendo, girl. Mhm.
[01:53] [Unknown]: I know. It starts to get cabin fever, going crazy inside.
[01:57] [Receptionist]: Yes, and y'all just got it a lot worse than we did. Porque el frío de ustedes tiene hielo, ¿verdad?
[02:05] [Unknown]: Yeah, and I think, yeah, like the roads, at least near me, have not been clear. Like, I know the sun's coming— coming out, but it's not melting anything. It just freezes right back up when the temperature drops again.
[02:19] [Receptionist]: Wow. Okay. Hopefully we'll be back to normal tomorrow.
[02:23] [Unknown]: Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully for y'all's— for y'all's sanity.
[02:27] [Receptionist]: I know. Okay, Miha, cuídate mucho.
[02:30] [Unknown]: All right, Mariela, let me know if you need anything.
[02:33] [Receptionist]: Okay, thank you. Bye.
[02:35] [Unknown]: Bye-bye.
