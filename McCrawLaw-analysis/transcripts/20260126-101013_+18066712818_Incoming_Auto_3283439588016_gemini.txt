----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 4]: This call is being recorded.
[00:06] [Receptionist]: Hey Jess.
[00:08] [Jessica]: Hey Kim, I have Kathy Powell on the phone. She said that she's been like dragging her feet on signing the DocuSign because she doesn't feel like she's actually injured at all.
[00:19] [Receptionist]: Oh, what? How come every time I've spoken to her husband, he's like, "Yeah, send it, send it"?
[00:25] [Jessica]: No, literally.
[00:27] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, okay, you can send her over. I'll probably re-check.
[00:33] [Jessica]: Okay, sounds good. Thank you.
[00:36] [Receptionist]: Okay, bye.
[00:41] [Receptionist]: Hi Kathy, this is Kimberly at the McCraw Law Group. How are you doing?
[00:43] [Kathy Powell]: I'm good. How are you?
[00:45] [Receptionist]: I'm doing good. Thank you for asking. Um, Ms. Jessica let me know, um, that you feel as though you're not too injured in this incident. Is that correct?
[00:58] [Kathy Powell]: I'm not injured at all. No. I'm not. Yeah, other than the fact that they found a little something on my thyroid, but, you know, that didn't, uh, didn't come from the accident, so.
[01:12] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I know I've spoken with Joe a couple of times. I haven't spoken directly with you. Um, but for the incident, he let me know to send some documents out to your email. Um, but if, but if you, you know, feel like you are not injured as a result of this accident and you're not looking to seek any other treatment, um, for the accident itself, I can void those documents out. You let me know how you're feeling, but if, if there's any part of you at all that, you know, is feeling different after the accident or if you want to speak more with an attorney to let you know how we can help you out, you let me know what you feel would be the best path for you.
[01:57] [Kathy Powell]: Okay. Yeah, I'm, I'm just, I'm good, you know, or I guess I saw it coming and was just kind of braced for it or, or thought, uh, this is coming and I didn't have time to say anything about it, but, you know, it just, it didn't affect me like it did Joe. And, uh, our grandson, it didn't affect him any either, but, uh, it was Joe. Of course, he already had a back that's been bothering him for years, so that just aggravated it. And he's still having problems with it. But yet they haven't been able to find anything, so anyway.
[02:38] [Receptionist]: I see. Okay. Well, you know, I'm glad to hear that, you know, it didn't affect you. If anything changes within the next few weeks or so, feel free to let us know. Um, you know, whenever there is an accident like this, we want to avoid any major gaps in treatment. So if you feel, if you start to feel anything, if anything changes, let us know as soon as possible, um, because there is a certain time limit from when we would have to start you into treatment for it to not affect your case. Um, but thank you for, for giving me a call back and let, letting me know. I know I hadn't spoken with you just yet, I've been communicating with, um, Joe. But I'll let our attorneys know. Um, you know, I'm glad to hear that you and your grandson were not affected by this, but if anything changes, feel free to give us a call back and let us know.
[03:27] [Kathy Powell]: Okay. I do have a question though. I've been getting a lot of calls from Asian people on this accident. There's not one that's called me that is an American.
[03:45] [Receptionist]: Oh, I see.
[03:47] [Kathy Powell]: And they're just bugging me, bugging me. And I'm not, we've not received any kind of communications from Progressive at all.
[04:00] [Receptionist]: I see. Um, so what may be happening there with getting different calls from different people. So we've taken over all communications with the insurance company in regards to Joe's claim. Um, so, so that's normal for Joe not to be communicating with anybody just in regards to his bodily injury claim. We've taken over all those communications so he doesn't have to worry about that. Um, but in regards to other people or other agencies or, um, entities giving you guys a call, sometimes what we, what we see is, unfortunately, when people are involved in an accident like this is, um, they get a lot of calls from what we call ambulance chasers. It's people who sit there and purchase police reports over and over to get people's information to see who was involved in a car accident and they start spamming them with calls, um, which is unfortunately not illegal in the state of Texas, um, but it is unethical and, um, I would, I would just let them know that, you know, what they're doing is unethical and they should not be reaching out to you purchasing your information and, and bothering you with spam calls. But it is what I want to say is most likely spam.
[05:20] [Kathy Powell]: Yeah, probably. Because it pops up on my phone scam alert, you know. And they're never, it's always a Chinese type name, you know. I'm going, "How come I'm not hearing from Progressive?", you know. "How come, how come it's always somebody from out of country and it's never, uh, from here in the states or..."
[05:48] [Receptionist]: Oh no. And I'm so sorry, you know, that you've had to go through that. So, so we've taken over all communications with the insurance company, so it's normal to not be hearing from them on Joe's claim. Um, and if Joe hears from them, it should be just in regards to the vehicle, um, as we've taken over all communication for the bodily injury. Um, but unfortunately these ambulance chasers, they do exist. They do sit there and purchase your information. Um, but most recently we've been made aware that the Texas Department of Transportation is doubling down on this and they're, they're making police reports harder to purchase. You have to go through a verification process. Um, so, so for people not to receive so much spam anymore and their information getting out after they've been in a car accident. So hopefully, you know, that should help. Um, but again, I'm so sorry that, you know, you've been experiencing that. Those spam, spam calls can be pesky.
[06:45] [Kathy Powell]: Yeah. Well, so what do we do about, uh, the, uh, adjusters? Because we haven't heard anything, well, we did from USAA, which is our insurance, but of course they said, "Well, we'll be out there Saturday." Well, it was, you know, the storm came in on Saturday, so I don't know if they came out before that or not, but Progressive sure not, has not reached out to us at all about the vehicle.
[07:20] [Receptionist]: Okay. About the vehicle. Okay. Let me, let me go ahead and send a message to your, to Joe's case manager, Crystal. Um, I'm the intake supervisor here at the McCraw Law Group, so I see like the oversee, the onboarding of your cases, but Ms. Crystal will have, since she is his assigned paralegal, she'll have more visibility on exactly what's going on with the insurances and where they're at and she'll be able to assist him with any communications in regards to the property damage and getting the vehicle evaluated. So I can go ahead and send her a message and have her reach back out to you guys to give you more of an update on exactly what's going on.
[07:59] [Kathy Powell]: Okay, that'd be great. I just, just call Joe on that.
[08:04] [Receptionist]: Okay. Yeah, she certainly has his number. I'll go ahead and send her a message so she can reach out as soon as possible and get the ball rolling for you guys on at least the, the vehicle portion as well.
[08:16] [Kathy Powell]: Yes. Okay, that'd be great.
[08:18] [Receptionist]: All right. Thank you for speaking with me, Kathy. You guys take care, stay warm, stay safe.
[08:23] [Kathy Powell]: Yep, you too.
[08:24] [Receptionist]: All right, have a good one. Bye-bye.
[08:26] [Kathy Powell]: Bye.
