[00:28] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Okay, and what was the reason that you were hoping to speak with the team about?
[00:34] [Joanne Jeter]: Um, I'm just kind of following up on our case. I got some, um, notifications from our insurance company and I'm just kind of wanting some guidance or seeing if he's aware of them and the notifications we got, just ask him about them.
