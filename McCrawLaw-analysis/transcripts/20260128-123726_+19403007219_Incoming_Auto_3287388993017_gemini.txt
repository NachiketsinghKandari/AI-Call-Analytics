[01:38] [Donald Gully]: Yes, ma'am. I've been shopping around for attorneys, so I'm trying to see who got the best ideas about how to help. Actually, I was in the Dallas County Jail, and I have stated in the record in advance because of allergic reaction I had to a medication. And they gave it to me in that way for seven months, and they gave it to me for seven years in the penitentiary, the same medication that had allergic reaction for me and called deteriorating bone. And so I've been diagnosed for the deteriorating bone, and I have witnesses nurses from the Denton County Jail while was shipped to from Dallas who's willing to testify that I was given this medication in the Dallas County Jail recently over the last year.
[02:40] [Donald Gully]: And they they stopped it when I made it to the Denton County Jail and told me that Dallas County gave it to me where I'd already stated that I had allergic reaction to it. And so I've been shopping around for attorneys who's willing to take the case, and I don't know if it's that's you or not.
[03:06] [Unknown Agent]: Okay. Yeah. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. You said they gave it to you for seven years?
[03:12] [Donald Gully]: Seven years in in a TDC, seven months in a Dallas County jail.
[03:19] [Unknown Agent]: Okay.
[03:21] [Donald Gully]: And this drug, since then, has been cited for deteriorating bone, and I'm a candidate. I'm also a cancer patient. And let me share with you about the conflict of interest because I sued them on another bad PO in the Zantac case where they actually won the litigation, and we're in process of suing the defendants now, settling with them. But that's totally different from this blood pressure medication that I was given.
[04:02] [Unknown Agent]: Mhmm.
[04:03] [Donald Gully]: And and I was hoping to make sure that I do it in a timely manner.
[04:10] [Unknown Agent]: Okay. Definitely. Alright. And how did you hear about us?
