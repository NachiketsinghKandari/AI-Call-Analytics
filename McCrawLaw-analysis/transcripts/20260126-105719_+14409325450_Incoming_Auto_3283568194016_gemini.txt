----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded.
[00:03] [Speaker 2]: This call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes.
[00:10] [Receptionist]: Hi, thanks for calling McCall Law Group, how can I help you?
[00:14] [Vicky]: Hello, my name is Vicky, I'm calling from Progressive. Um, I am calling to see who the case manager or paralegal is on a claim.
[00:24] [Receptionist]: Okay, well let me see. Did you say your name was Vicky?
[00:27] [Vicky]: Yes.
[00:28] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Is this the best callback number for you, the one ending in 5450?
[00:34] [Vicky]: It is.
[00:36] [Receptionist]: Okay, and then, do y'all have an email address you'd like us to have on file for you?
[00:44] [Vicky]: Um, yeah, I don't think so, because we're not— it's not always the same adjuster, so.
[00:51] [Receptionist]: Sure. What's the client's name?
[00:54] [Vicky]: Client's name is Rebecca Weaver.
[00:58] [Receptionist]: Sure. Okay. Let me see if anyone is available. Give me just a moment.
[01:04] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[01:13] [Receptionist]: It looks like I don't have any transfer lines open, but I am happy to take a message for you. Are there any other details you'd like me to add?
[01:22] [Vicky]: Um, no, actually, I'm just looking through, I don't see that you guys have sent an LOR yet.
[01:31] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[01:32] [Vicky]: At least I'm not finding it at the moment. So if you can send over— oh, maybe this is it, let me see. They might have found it, they just didn't label it for some reason. Oh, okay.
[01:47] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay.
[01:48] [Vicky]: Okay, yeah, we have it. So no worries there.
[01:51] [Receptionist]: Oh, perfect. No problem.
[01:53] [Vicky]: Um, yeah, so if you just want whoever the case manager is, I just want to call and get some information on this particular claim, because when I look at her coverages, it doesn't look like she even has PIP on her policy.
[02:11] [Receptionist]: Okay. I'll get that right over for you, Vicky.
[02:14] [Vicky]: Thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of your day.
[02:17] [Receptionist]: Thanks, you too. Bye.
[02:19] [Vicky]: Thanks, bye.
[02:21] [Receptionist]: Bye.
[02:22] [Vicky]: Bye.
