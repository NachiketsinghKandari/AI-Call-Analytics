[02:09] [Receptionist]: So Charlie is not available, I'm so sorry.
[02:13] [James Payne]: Oh, y'all have busy attorneys. Nobody's sitting in their office, huh?
[02:19] [Receptionist]: Yeah, um, I believe they're— they're having a meeting currently.
[02:25] [James Payne]: Oh, so they're in a meeting all together, no wonder. Uh, how long will that meeting last, do you think?
