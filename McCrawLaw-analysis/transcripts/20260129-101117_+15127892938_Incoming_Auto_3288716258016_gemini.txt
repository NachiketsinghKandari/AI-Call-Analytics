[04:20] SPEAKER 2: So the ambulance checked the EMT checked me out in the ambulance. Okay. And my vitals were good. My blood pressure was skyrocketed. They wanted to take me to the hospital, but I felt like I was okay, so I declined.
[04:41] SPEAKER 2: Then through the next few days, I started to have, you know, just the general pain, but I I hurt my knee. I'm not sure how. I guess maybe moving my foot so quickly to the brake. I Oh, okay. Did something to my knee, and and then my chest was hurting.
[05:10] SPEAKER 2: So I went back to the ER. I got the information from the insurance company so that they would pay for the hospital visit. Okay. So I got that covered with them. I gave them the claim number, the hospital, the claim number, everything.

   [ ... Hold / Silence (6s) ... ]

[06:01] SPEAKER 1: Okay. Nothing broken?
[06:04] SPEAKER 2: No. Yeah. They did X rays of my knee and my ankle. Nothing was broken, but that's all they could see in the X-ray. Right.
[06:14] SPEAKER 2: Then they did a chest CT scan with the contrast dye. Okay. And that all looked okay. So she thought see, I was having trouble swallowing. Not in my throat, but down lower in my chest, my esophagus.
[06:41] SPEAKER 2: Oh my goodness. So the doctor has prescribed me some medication, which I'm just starting today. Since the ice storm, I wasn't able to get to this.
[06:53] SPEAKER 1: Right. Right. Okay.
[06:55] SPEAKER 2: Go pick it up. But she thought that there was probably I've had some swelling, which had caused the esophagus to have some issues. But in this CT scan, it was all looking okay.
[07:14] SPEAKER 1: Okay.
[07:15] SPEAKER 2: And then my knee, nothing is broken. So they the insurance, you know, when they gave me the information to pay to the hospital to have them pay for the bill. Mhmm. She said she was gonna call me on Thursday to check on me and offer me a settlement. I didn't really know what that meant, but from what my friend had said, you need to talk to somebody.
[07:47] SPEAKER 2: My main issue, I think, is my knee because I know that can be an ongoing issue.
[07:56] SPEAKER 1: Correct.
[07:56] SPEAKER 2: The doctor said it yeah. The doctor said it would take, like, four to six weeks to notice a big change getting better or not. So I don't know. Is this the fact I don't know what's gonna happen in the future and what I'm gonna need. So I don't know what I'm supposed to do about this settlement.
[08:20] SPEAKER 2: Is
[08:20] SPEAKER 1: your knee swollen?
[08:24] SPEAKER 2: It is a little bit. Okay. Not a lot. It's mainly just really sore.
[08:32] SPEAKER 1: Sore. Okay. And whenever they went take took you out, did they use the Jaws of Life, or they had to really yank the door?
[08:41] SPEAKER 2: No. They just had to really yank the door because Okay. The frame, you had gone into compacted into the Wow. Doors. Sorry about that.
[08:53] SPEAKER 2: The airbags did not go off.
[08:55] SPEAKER 1: They didn't? Oh my goodness. Which,
[09:02] SPEAKER 2: I guess, maybe it was a blessing to, like, disguise because I wasn't injured than from any airbag. Mhmm. And the seat belt held me in.
[09:16] SPEAKER 1: Maybe that's why your chest is hurting. No. I don't know. I'm just saying.
[09:19] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Yeah. That is. Yeah. It was so hard.
[09:24] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. That's yeah. Because I did have some bruising where the seat belt was.
[09:29] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. Oh my goodness. And how about eating and sleeping? Are you doing okay with that?
[09:38] SPEAKER 2: Well, my knee hurts so bad that, you know, it wakes me up in the night. So I've been taking some the doctor told me not to take ibuprofen, to take some extra strength Tylenol. So that's been helping a little bit.
[09:58] SPEAKER 1: Good. Good. And that's all you're taking for the pain? Yes. K.
[10:07] SPEAKER 1: And are you do you have a doctor's appointment or anything like that to check your knee out or anything as of now?
[10:18] SPEAKER 2: No. They didn't see anything in the X-ray. Okay. Doctor didn't think that I would have torn a meniscus or anything just from moving my leg that fast. I think I just jacked it up.
[10:32] SPEAKER 2: You know? Not really sure, but but, like, it nothing showed in the X-ray.
[10:39] SPEAKER 1: Good. Good. I'm happy to hear that. How are you eating? So you're still having problems with swallowing, I mean, down in the chest.
[10:48] SPEAKER 1: Correct?
[10:48] SPEAKER 2: It's I guess because some swelling irritated the esophagus. So I just picked up the medication that I can start taking that's gonna help that.
[11:03] SPEAKER 1: So were you stranded too for a few days because of the ice storm?
[11:10] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. That's why I would've gone to the ER sooner, but I didn't wanna have an accident trying to get there. So I didn't get to I didn't get back to the emergency room till Tuesday.
