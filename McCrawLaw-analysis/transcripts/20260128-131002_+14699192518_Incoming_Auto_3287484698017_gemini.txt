[00:13] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling the McCloud Group, how can I help you?
[00:16] [Emily]: Hi, my name is Emily, I work at Blue Zone Medical, and I was just wondering if I could talk to the case manager for one of our patients.
[00:24] [Receptionist]: I can check if they're available, yeah. This is Emily, right, from Blue Zone Medical?
[00:29] [Emily]: Yes.
[00:30] [Receptionist]: Okay. I think the email is records at bluezonemedical.us, right?
[00:36] [Emily]: Yes, that's correct.
[00:37] [Receptionist]: Okay. Can you help me with the name of the patient while I get a response if someone is available to take the call?
[00:42] [Emily]: Yes, his name is James Welch.
[00:47] [Receptionist]: J-A-M-E-S Welch, W-E-L-C-H?
[00:51] [Emily]: Yes, correct.
[00:53] [Receptionist]: Okay. Was there something in specific that you needed?
[00:58] [Emily]: Um, so we haven't seen this patient since November 6th. Um, and last I spoke with him, he— I believe he was in a second accident, but it may or may not have been like workers' comp related. So I was just calling to see if we were able to close him out or just kind of what was going on.
[01:19] [Receptionist]: Okay. So, they told me that there's no one available right now, but I did add your information. Now for the— for a callback number, I do see one that ends in 2515, is that the right one? 469-919-2515?
[01:40] [Emily]: Uh, it's 2518.
[01:43] [Receptionist]: Okay. Yeah, I do see that one here. Okay, let me just change it, that would be the best number. Does it have an extension or is it a direct number?
[01:51] [Emily]: It's a direct number.
[01:53] [Receptionist]: Okay. Okay, you are all set. I'll submit it right now to my team.
[02:04] [Emily]: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
[02:07] [Receptionist]: Thanks. Hope you have a good day.
