[ ... Silence (8s) ... ]
[00:12] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling McCraw Law Group, how can we help you?
[00:15] [Adrian Castle]: Yes, my name is Adrian Castle, I'm sorry, who am I speaking with?
[00:19] [Receptionist]: My name is Ken, I'm a receptionist here for the office.
[00:23] [Adrian Castle]: Ken, I appreciate you, um, introducing yourself. Hey, the reason I'm calling today is I wanted to find out, does your, uh, practice still do dog bites?
[00:32] [Receptionist]: Um, yes, we do. Is this the first time you've contacted us about this?
[00:37] [Adrian Castle]: Um, it is not, and I'm doing a follow-up call. I was a, uh, client of Mullen and Mullen, and they could not find that the owner had any, the liable party had any insurance. Um, so I had called your office to find out if you guys actually just allow the client to pay for the fees out of pocket for representation, and I was told that you don't. So I'm calling again today because I did find out, uh, through some search that the liable owner does have insurance on his house through another home that he owns.
[01:13] [Receptionist]: I understand. Okay. Do you recall how long ago had you contacted us about this matter?
[01:18] [Adrian Castle]: Uh, maybe seven to 10 days ago, maybe two weeks. As at that, and at that time, I believe that the owner did not have insurance. And that's when your, your office said, "Oh, we wouldn't take a case if they don't have insurance."
[01:32] [Receptionist]: Okay. All righty. I would like to, um, confirm some information with you and we can definitely look into this again for you and see what can be done. Um, can you confirm your, your first name is Adrian, and what's your last name?
[01:44] [Adrian Castle]: Castle. C-A-S-T-L-E.
[01:47] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much, Mr. Castle. Is the best phone number for you 469-682-0247?
[01:53] [Adrian Castle]: It is.
[01:54] [Receptionist]: Okay. And can you provide me with the best email for you?
[02:02] [Adrian Castle]: A-D-R-I-A-N, as in Nancy, C, as in cat, 0128 at Yahoo.
[02:11] [Receptionist]: Okay. Could you provide me with your physical address as well, please?
[02:22] [Adrian Castle]: 7452 Creekmere Drive, Frisco, Texas, 75035.
[02:33] [Receptionist]: Um, I would like to make sure, so that's 7452, and what's the name of the drive?
[02:41] [Adrian Castle]: Creekmere. C-R-E-E-K-M-E-R-E.
[02:46] [Receptionist]: M-E-R-E. Mm, thank you so much. That's why. Okay. And the Frisco 75035, right?
[02:53] [Adrian Castle]: Correct.
[02:54] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Okay.
[ ... Silence (25s) ... ]
[03:21] [Receptionist]: Okay. I don't have someone immediately available from my legal team, but I'm going to get this over to the right hands so we can follow up with you and confirm if we can, we can take this on. Um, just in case if we were to follow up at a bad time, we'll make sure to leave a message, but I would just ask for you to please wait for the, the call back and the team would be able to confirm the next steps, okay?
[03:46] [Adrian Castle]: I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
[03:48] [Receptionist]: Thank you for your time. I hope you have a great day.
[03:51] [Adrian Castle]: You too. Bye-bye.
