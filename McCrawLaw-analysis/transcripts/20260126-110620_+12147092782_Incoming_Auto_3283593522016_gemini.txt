[01:21] [Receptionist]: All right, I got nlondon07 at yahoo. And may I have a good, um, physical address as well?
[01:28] [Nick London]: Uh, give me one second. Just moved. Okay. It is, uh, 7310 Dartmouth Drive, Rowlett, Texas, 75089.
[01:52] [Receptionist]: And Dartmouth is D-A-R-T-M-O-U-T-H?
[01:56] [Nick London]: Yes, ma'am.
[01:59] [Receptionist]: Um, which county is that?
[02:03] [Nick London]: Uh, it's Dallas County.
[02:05] [Receptionist]: Dallas, okay. All right, and may I ask the details of your case?
[02:13] [Nick London]: It's involving a motorcycle and, uh, I guess it would be maybe a class action or lemon law issue, product defect.
[02:21] [Receptionist]: Okay. Okay.
[02:23] [ ... Silence (16s) ... ]
[02:39] [Receptionist]: And how did you hear about us originally?
[02:42] [Nick London]: Actually, I just searched online and I found you guys. I don't know which website it was.
[02:48] [Receptionist]: Okay, no problem. Yeah. Okay, perfect. And you said you're in the Dallas area. And have you spoken with us in the office regarding this before?
[02:57] [Nick London]: I have not. I basically sent you guys an email and I got an email back saying that you guys would be willing to take on my case because it's something that you guys specialize in.
[03:07] [Receptionist]: Okay, gotcha.
[03:09] [ ... Silence (22s) ... ]
[03:31] [Receptionist]: Okay, so it actually looks like this would be outside of our practice area, um, and that we wouldn't be able to assist, but I do have a referral to the Dallas Bar Association that I can give you.
[04:00] [Nick London]: I tried calling them and they, they just stand me up every time. They set up an appointment to call me and I never get a phone call back.
[04:07] [Receptionist]: Oh, I'm sorry. Um... Yeah, yeah. Um, because typically we deal with like, you know, motor vehicle accidents, slip and fall liabilities, bites, things like that, so mostly, um, personal injury law.
[04:25] [Nick London]: Okay. I appreciate your time.
[04:27] [Receptionist]: Oh yeah, thank you for calling. You enjoy the rest of your day.
