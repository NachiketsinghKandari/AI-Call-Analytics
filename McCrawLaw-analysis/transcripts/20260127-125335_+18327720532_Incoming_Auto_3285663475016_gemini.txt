[00:24] [Receptionist]: All right, and do you have an email address that we can add into your profile as well?
[00:29] [Stephanie]: Um, we don't have anything direct. I can give you the general Geico email if you want it.

[01:20] [Stephanie]: You got it.
[01:21] [Receptionist]: All right, and were you looking for a case status update on the client?
[01:24] [Stephanie]: Um, well we had an offer out, so checking up on that or if there was anything additional we needed to review, yeah.
[01:32] [Receptionist]: Yeah, okay. Gotcha. So I don't have anyone available for you to speak with right now and I don't have access to client information as an intake receptionist, so I can just get this over to the legal team and have them correspond with you as soon as they're able.
[01:46] [Stephanie]: Yeah, absolutely. That's fine.
[01:49] [Receptionist]: Awesome. And did you want to provide the claim number in case they do email you back?

[02:06] [Receptionist]: Thank you. I'll repeat that back as 885 403 040 000 000 01.
[02:18] [Stephanie]: Should be seven zeros.
[02:20] [Receptionist]: Okay, yeah, I thought I missed a zero, but I got it. I got the zeros. Thank you. And then your best callback is still the 852-772-0532?
[02:30] [Stephanie]: Yes, ma'am.
[02:32] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Okay, I will go ahead and get this to them for you, okay?
