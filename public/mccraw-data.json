Okay, and just need a little bit more information to see how we can help you, if we can take the case. Can you tell me what the case is about?\n[01:29] [Gwen Allen]: I purchased a home about a year ago, found out that it has tons of mold in it after the fact. Um, there's issues with the inspection because I did have a licensed mold assessor that was paid upon inspection prior to buying. And then it's been, as it's been damaged a couple of times by contractors, um, that made the mold worse. Um, I had a remediator in December that was supposed to be removing the mold and they abandoned the house in the middle of the job and they seem to be acting deceptive and hiding all of the photos of of what was actually done. Um, that's kind of like in a nutshell.\n[02:26] [Receptionist]: Okay, I I understand. Um, and you were wanting to seek damages from these contractors?\n[02:35] [Gwen Allen]: Yeah, I mean, I need help. I've learned a little bit from consulting with a couple of lawyers that I talked to for an hour that, like, I need to file a TDLR complaint. It's best to have an attorney do that that is, like, mold trained or aware, um, since it is a mold house case. So I'm I'm trying to find someone that actually— because he specializes in mold, that's what the website said, right?\n[03:07] [Receptionist]: Uh, r— I'm actually not quite sure what our current website is saying about specializing with mold. I don't want to give you wrong information here. Can I ask, how did you hear about us? Were you referred via that attorney that you mentioned earlier?\n[03:24] [Gwen Allen]: No, just searching for toxic mold lawyer.\n[03:30] [Receptionist]: Okay, I understand. Okay, and can I have your callback number in case we get disconnected? This number ending in 6673, is that a good callback number?\n[03:42] [Gwen Allen]: Yes.\n[03:43] [Receptionist]: Yes, okay, great. Thank you.

Okay, great. Thank you so much. And can I have the— can you give me the flower mound address?\n[04:12] [Gwen Allen]: 1333 River Oaks Drive, Flower Mound, 75028.\n[04:28] [Receptionist]: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Okay, I'm just double-checking some information here, please give me another moment.\n\n[04:49] [ ... Silence (622s) ... ]\n\n[15:11] [Gwen Allen]: Hello? Yeah, can you hear me? The connection— the connection's really hard to understand you, so if we're trying to do an intake, maybe I should call you back because the it's really hard to understand.\n[15:24] [Receptionist]: Oh, uh, if you want to call us back, please feel free to do so. I was just about to place you or I was just about to transfer you to someone who can further assist you. If you if it's too bad, then you can just call again.\n[15:39] [Gwen Allen]: Okay. Well, yeah, let's see if the transfer fixes the connection because it's hard to understand. It's still really crackly.\n[15:47] [Receptionist]: Okay, I just need to ask you one more question. Can you tell me what kind of injuries did you sustain?\n[15:56] [Gwen Allen]: Well, the house is damaged to where it's unlivable. I've moved out of the house.\n[16:07] [Receptionist]: Okay. And do you have any personal injuries?\n[16:10] [Gwen Allen]: I don't know.\n[16:13] [Receptionist]: Okay, I'll just make note of that. That's okay. Okay, I'm going to try to transfer you now, okay?

I am calling because I have been trying to get in touch with y'all for a while about a case you guys are handling involving a student and an incident that occurred with an SRO in Mesquite ISD. I did speak with Paola Lopez about this in December and have exchanged a couple emails with her since. I am very interested in speaking with the attorney handling this case, mainly because we are working at the Times on a project that is relevant to what allegedly occurred there. We have a video clip of the incident that we may reference in the story and I just really want to be able to kind of share information with the legal team about what we're doing. I'm just wondering if you can connect me with someone or give me any clarity on when that might happen?\n[01:12] [Receptionist]: Okay, yeah, give me one moment, let me go ahead and see if I can get you over to that attorney. If not, I can also see, I know you spoke with Paola, but we also have our Chief Marketing Officer, Yvonne. I can see if I can also connect her over to her as well. One moment.\n[01:31] [Claire Amari]: That would be fantastic. Who is the lawyer working on it?\n[01:35] [Receptionist]: Give me one moment. I am so sorry for that long hold there, it does look like Yvonne, our Chief Marketing Officer, as well as the attorney, Charlie Ginn, is currently unavailable. But I can go ahead and forward them a message that way they can reach out to you as soon as they can. Can I get a good callback number for you?\n[01:56] [Claire Amari]: Sure.

Okay.\n[02:21] [Receptionist]: And then did you also have Yvonne's email? Has Paola provided that for you?\n[02:25] [Claire Amari]: I don't immediately know, but why don't you pass it along just in case so I can direct emails to her?\n[02:34] [Receptionist]: Okay, perfect. Yvonne Kinser. Her email is I, then her last name, Kinser, that is K-I-N-S-E-R @ mccrawlawgroup.com.\n[02:52] [Claire Amari]: .com. All right, I will email her directly and thank you for that.

Silence (12s) ... ]\n[01:23] [Receptionist]: I don't have anyone available right now that I can transfer you to. Can I forward a message for you?\n[01:31] [Stephanie Murphy]: Uh, yeah, I guess. Um, it's just been two years since the accident and I haven't heard anything. And, uh, he said that they were, um, the— I don't know, whoever was handling the accident, he's handling the case, but he said the insurance company's fighting over which county it happened in because it happened on county line or something. But, um, he said that's what's tangled up and, uh, McKinney Medical Center is trying to fine me $15,000 because of late fees and services or whatever. And I had to tell them that it's an ongoing case and everything. So, I'm just, I guess, trying to call and check up and see what's going on and see where this is going because, uh, I have bulging discs in my neck because of this accident and I do need surgery. Um, I'm trying to figure out what my next steps are as far as getting my neck surgery done and I don't know if they pay for the neck surgery or if they pay me out and then I pay for my neck surgery or what, but I kind of need it done because I got hurt at work last year and, uh, I need surgery on my arm as well from work. So I'm just, I guess, trying to get everything taken care of so I could get better.\n[03:07] [Receptionist]: Yes, I understand. Um, I don't have anyone available right now, but I will forward this message to the team. Um, and some— and they'll— someone will reach out to you as soon as possible.\n[03:18] [Stephanie Murphy]: All right, thank you.\n[03:20] [Receptionist]: Thank you.

I was wondering if I could either speak with Ariana or Drake, whoever's available. They're, they're working my case.\n[00:16] [Receptionist]: Uh, she— give me one moment, please.\n[00:18] [Ryan Fields]: No problem.\n[00:20] [Receptionist]: Okay, so the case manager for your case is currently unavailable. May I take a message and forward it for you?\n[00:28] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, I just, I— I really, they can just send me an email if they want to, they don't even have to give me a call back. I just, I had submitted my release for, uh, like, like my case was getting settled and everything, so I had sent over a release and, like, wiring docs and everything about two and a half weeks ago, and then I've just never heard anything else about it. Um, I spoke with Drake last Friday and he said he hadn't heard anything from them, but that he'd check on it and he was supposed to either call me back like end of the day Friday, um, or call me back on, on Monday, and then I've called a couple times and I've just never heard anything back. So I was just looking for some kind of update.\n[01:05] [Receptionist]: Do you want me to see— I can, um, check if Drake is available?\n[01:09] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, yeah, if you can check if Drake's available, that'd be fine. I, yeah.\n[01:12] [Receptionist]: Give me one moment, please.\n[01:14] [Ryan Fields]: Cool, thank you.\n[01:17] [Drake]: Hey Ryan, this is Drake, how you doing?\n[01:20] [Ryan Fields]: Hey Drake, I'm doing well, how you doing, man?\n[01:22] [Drake]: Good, good, just getting ready for this weather. But hey, I know you're probably calling about the, the check. I have not got it yet. So I have—\n[01:29] [Ryan Fields]: Okay, yeah, I was, yeah, Drake, you're good. I was just calling for an update. I just had to make sure that I was doing my due diligence on my side.\n[01:34] [Drake]: No, I hear you a million percent. And usually we get it by this point, so let me follow up with them again and see what—\n[01:41] [Ryan Fields]: So, and that was one— and so that was one thing that I had, so I had forgot to mention this last time we talked. So, I know y'all didn't— y'all weren't really involved in, like, the property side of getting everything done, but they put me through a very similar rigmarole when it came down to actually paying the body shop.\n[01:57] [Drake]: Okay.\n[01:58] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, so the car— so my car, like, 'cause you know they put me through that whole rigmarole of taking six months to even take the car to go get fixed, right? Or it was like four or five months. So the car ended up being done at the end of May, and then they gave me, like, a whole big headache back and forth on if they were even going to send me a check or when they were going to send it and the whole thing. So they finally send it, they send it to me, it gets to me by the middle of June, and then they had cut it from, uh, what was called the Royal Bank of Canada.\n[02:31] [Drake]: Oh wow.\n[02:32] [Ryan Fields]: So when I took it to go deposit it, they told me that it was going to take a minimum of 35 days to be able to clear my account because it was an international check. And then, um, so then, you know, the body shop wasn't really trying to accept that as an answer, so then I had to go do a whole another, like, two weeks of back and forth with them to finally get them to just do an electronic wire transfer to me. And that ended up finally coming. So like I said, my car ended up being done end of May, but because of the whole shenanigans they put me through on funds, I couldn't pick it up until July 3rd. Like, literally, like, the day— like the day that Haley found out that she had to get— ended up having to get surgery.\n[03:08] [Drake]: Oh wow.\n[03:09] [Ryan Fields]: So that was just one thing I wanted to put, like, kind of, you know, in the background so that way y'all know that that might be something they're trying to do again or trying to whatever. So I don't know if y'all have a way to, like, step the wires, but y'all might have one.\n[03:19] [Drake]: Yeah, I'm going to be proactive on it and kind of send, not a threatening email, but a strongly worded email to try and get this.\n[03:26] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah.\n[03:27] [Drake]: Yeah, and I would imagine, you know, I mean, they're probably not, you know, itching to cut a $60,000 check.\n[03:34] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, yeah, no, I hear you, I hear you. So, okay.\n[03:37] [Drake]: Yeah, I got you. I appreciate you following up. I'm going to go ahead and, uh, reach out to them again and see what the delay is and let them know, hey, we've had this issue in the past, let's not delay this any further, let's just make sure it all gets done properly and efficiently.\n[03:51] [Ryan Fields]: Perfect, perfect. Well, I appreciate you, man. Um, is there anything that you're needing from me or anything, or anything you need from Haley at the moment?\n[03:57] [Drake]: Not right now. Everything's going smoothly. Um, we're just still working on, uh, getting everything going with her, and then once I have a good update for you for either of y'all, I'll give you a call, okay?\n[04:08] [Ryan Fields]: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.\n[04:10] [Drake]: Thanks Ryan. Bye now.\n[04:11] [Ryan Fields]: Thanks.

May I forward a message for you and um make sure that we have a good uh callback number?\n[00:36] [Deborah Boyer]: Well, I had several questions for her, uh, so I probably just need to talk to her.\n[00:46] [Receptionist]: Okay, I can make sure that she knows that you contacted and that you have several questions for her.\n[00:53] [Deborah Boyer]: Yeah.\n[00:54] [Receptionist]: Okay. And she should be reaching out when she can.\n[00:58] [Deborah Boyer]: Okay. What time do y'all close today? If she's— if I haven't heard from her by what time should I go ahead and— like I have some errands to run and stuff, but I can wait.\n[01:15] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. I'm not too sure if Emma is um scheduled today, but I will make sure that she does receive this message and that she knows that you called and that she knows that you have um questions for her.\n[01:31] [Deborah Boyer]: Okay, but like if I haven't heard from her by six, then probably I'm not going to hear from her today, is that safe to assume?\n[01:45] [Receptionist]: Our regular office hours are till five, so um I would, yeah, I would assume, yeah.\n[01:52] [Deborah Boyer]: Okay. All right, well I'll just make sure I have my phone with me until then. And if not, well then hopefully I'll hear from her next week or so.\n[02:01] [Receptionist]: I will definitely make sure that she knows that you called and so that she can reach out to you.\n[02:07] [Deborah Boyer]: Well, we scheduled— one of the important ones is we scheduled the deposition in April. And if you can leave her the message there's a possibility I might have to change that. We just scheduled it yesterday, so— but I got some information last night.\n[02:26] [Receptionist]: Gotcha, okay. I will let her know that you possibly um may need to change on that date.\n[02:32] [Deborah Boyer]: Okay, thank you.\n[02:34] [Receptionist]: Of course. Thank you for calling.

But in the recovery room, you know, when I went to get her, they said that she was taking longer to wake up. And so when she got to Louisville Hospital Medical City, she they took well, they told me that her eyes were dilated. So the doctor the ER doctor said her eyes were shut. And so he started telling me stuff about her blood blood pressure was high, her sugar level was high, and then they said she was having swelling to her brain.\n[03:47] SPEAKER 2: So he told me that she was not getting enough oxygen to her brain, which caused her to go into cardiac arrest. And so he went in to check on it, and he came back, and he told me, well, good news was that the eyes dilated a bit. It didn't get back to the pupils didn't get back to the actual normal size, but it was not as enlarged as it was when he and she got there and he saw her for the first time. So they had to move transport her because her her brain the swelling was not stopping. So they transported her to the Medical City in Plano Brain and Spine emergency, you know, facility.\n[04:45] SPEAKER 2: And so she stayed in a coma, and they said she had high high hypoxia hypoxia.\n[04:54] SPEAKER 3: How did you hear about us, Dory?\n[04:57] SPEAKER 2: Say again, ma'am?\n[04:59] SPEAKER 3: How did you hear about us?\n[05:01] SPEAKER 2: You said how did I hear?

Um...\n[00:08] [Speaker 1]: Good morning. How are you?\n[00:11] [Speaker 2]: I'm good, how are you?\n[00:12] [Speaker 1]: Good. I was gonna Teams you about it—\n[00:16] [Speaker 2]: Kayla Franco? Or what's her name?\n[00:19] [Speaker 1]: Katie. I was gonna talk to you about that, but I just feel weird Teamsing it. I don't know. Um, so I know that Derek is learning and stuff, but yeah, so I've had two cases come in, no date of birth, wrong phone number. Um, so Yaylee's, um, she put in the emergency contact's phone number, um, and she didn't put a date of birth, you know, the last name was misspelled. And then with Katie, um, an address is not in there, it just says McKinney, Texas, so like the full address is not in there, date of birth is not in there. So I'm, I don't mind doing it, it's just—\n[01:12] [Speaker 2]: Okay. No, no, no, don't do it. I will let her know.\n[01:15] [Speaker 1]: Okay. And so would you prefer us tell you or tell her directly? I just, I don't want to, you know, I don't know what you like or you prefer, so I don't want to step on toes or anything and I don't want to sound like, you know!\n[01:32] [Speaker 2]: No, no, no, it's fine. And whatever you prefer, if you prefer to tell me directly, that's fine. And or if you feel better going directly to her, that's fine also. That way, like, I feel like sometimes I'm like, \"Hey, remember to add this,\" that way they don't think it's just me, like, yes, case managers are noticing because they need these things, you know? Yeah.\n[01:51] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, and I think, um, I don't know if the other girls have noticed anything, but I've noticed that and stuff that she's, you know, doing. And I know she's new, like I said, I know she's new, I know she's training and so I just want to get your preference on like, do you want us going directly to you, do you want us going directly to her? Just because sometimes it's better if they hear it from, you know, their, um, their supervisor or something like that. If not, if you don't mind, then I don't mind either. I just, I just want to know, you know, what your preference is.\n[02:22] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, I don't mind you tell— letting them know directly, or even if you want to do a group chat.\n[02:27] [Speaker 1]: Okay.\n[02:28] [Speaker 2]: Because sometimes I'm like, \"Dang it, I hope they don't think I'm nagging them too much as well.\"\n[02:33] [Speaker 1]: No, yeah. I got it.\n[02:34] [Speaker 2]: Because case managers do need these things, so I hope they don't think I'm just sitting here and like, nitpicking everything they do, because this stuff is needed.\n[02:43] [Speaker 1]: Right. And that's the other thing too, I don't want to sound like I'm the one nitpicking, but it's just, you know, it's stuff that she's doing in there. But I just wanted to bring it to your attention. I can talk to her as well. Um, no issues, just wanted to make sure, you know, wanted to make sure what your preference was and what your process— processes are, so.\n[03:03] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, either way. Um, but if you want for these two, I'll let her know. Can you just send me a Teams of what you noticed was missing?\n[03:14] [Speaker 1]: Okay. Um, yeah, because on Yaylee's it won't matter anymore because I already went in and did it. I should have asked you first, so I apologize. But on this one... I did send out Yaylee's, um, authorizations.\n[03:31] [Speaker 2]: Mhm.\n[03:32] [Speaker 1]: Yes, I saw that in there in the file. So thank you for that.\n[03:35] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, and I'm so sorry about that on the name spelling. That was probably my fault. She came in during my weekend.\n[03:42] [Speaker 1]: Oh, gotcha. Because her intake is spelled correctly.\n[03:46] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Yeah, because in the— the whenever on whenever we input the DocuSign, it doesn't let them change the name, but on the intake they can input whatever name, but on signatures they can't change.\n[04:07] [Speaker 1]: Gotcha.\n[04:09] [Speaker 2]: But, so sorry about that. And I was going to talk to you about Katie Franco anyways, because I think you've had mom before, Maria de la Garza? Or was that Esther?\n[04:25] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, I had— well, Esther had her and then I got her daughter, but I still spoke to mom anyway.\n[04:32] [Speaker 2]: Oh, okay. Um, you said on Katie it was date of birth, phone number, and address?\n[04:40] [Speaker 1]: Uh, just incomplete address and date of birth. No, phone number's fine.\n[04:44] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Okay, I will ask her to go back in and create that. Um, or add that in. I also wanted to talk to you about this case anyway. Honestly, I don't think there's going to be a source of recovery. Um, we kind of took it on because mom just didn't know what to do to help them out and see if we could investigate. Um, but this girl is 28 years old, I don't think she really knows what's going on, like, at any time, because she had this car that has a lien on it and she was telling mom this entire time, \"No, I do have insurance on it. The lienor gave me insurance.\" Right? But then the letter that she sent from the lienor is they placed a, um, CPI insurance, which I think it's a... I don't...\n[05:41] [Speaker 1]: I think it's just coverage for like collision and, and I can't remember what, but I was looking at it this morning.\n[05:49] [Speaker 2]: Yeah. Um, they placed this on there because she never got— you know how you buy a car and you have to have full coverage on it? She never got it. So this entire time she thought they were just giving her this insurance when she bought the car.\n[06:01] [Speaker 1]: Got it.\n[06:02] [Speaker 2]: And mom says that she attempted to add this car onto their Allstate policy and, like, it would not let them. And then, I don't know, but it ended up being a rollover, so Drake said we should take it on and investigate, especially since they're previous clients. Yeah. But I'm not very hopeful on coverage, but just wanted to let you know.\n[06:26] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, I was looking at it this morning and I was talking to Drake about it and maybe we can hit mom's insurance if they still live together. So like a resident relative type deal. Um, and we might be able to hit mom's policy, which I'm pretty sure she had minimum, but I'm going to ask for like, you know, updated stuff from her. I mean, I don't know how that's going to go. I mean, she's— she's 28 years old, she should be able to handle her own stuff, but you know, mom was the one that called in, which that when I saw that I was like, \"Come on now.\"\n[07:00] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, they were both— I ended up talking to Katie more. Um, so that's why we put her number there, so she does answer, but she has mom on the phone with her as well. And then I'm like, \"Katie, would you rather speak in Spanish or English?\" And then she's like, \"Spanish.\" So then I'm talking to mom the entire time in Spanish and then Katie will answer me back in English, so then I talk to her in English.\n[07:21] [Speaker 1]: Oh my goodness.\n[07:22] [Speaker 2]: You gotta— you gotta be consistent, Katie.\n[07:24] [Speaker 1]: I know.\n[07:25] [Speaker 2]: Because she doesn't understand Spanish, but then if you're talking to mom you have to talk in Spanish.\n[07:29] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, Maria doesn't, yeah.\n[07:31] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, but she's really sweet. She's a really sweet lady. Um, and she seems to have more of a grasp on things than, you know, now that she's been through this herself, her daughter, and now this other daughter.\n[07:45] [Speaker 1]: So she kind of knows and she gets it, but I can talk to both if need be. But, um, I just wanted to let you know that, but thank you. I appreciate it. Well, see, maybe— maybe we'll get a recovery from— for this one. Maybe. Hopefully.\n[08:00] [Speaker 2]: All right. If you happen to talk to anybody that's in office, let me know.\n[08:05] [Speaker 1]: I will let you— yes, I will let you know. Like I said, Charlie said he was going to be in, but uh, I don't know, Charlie.\n[08:12] [Speaker 2]: I— I doubt it.\n[08:14] [Speaker 1]: Yeah. But we'll see.\n[08:17] [Speaker 2]: All right.

Uh, while she, she was a minor as well, but, um, she was like seen in the ER the next day and they documented her wrist and, uh, like her back injuries. They did like some in— imaging.

And, um, like the lady, um, in that, uh, she admitted fault and, um, but we weren't able no bodily injury, um, claim or anything wasn't open, so initially, so we just trying to see what I should do next.

Yeah, there were, uh, for my daughter, it was four of her friends in the car, um, she was in the car, the passenger side, and when the car hit. So, um, I think like her mom's been having to deal with everything, but I didn't know that I had to call, so I was like, oh, okay, so this whole time I've been thinking, um, she was having to speak, you know, to a lawyer or her claim, but it was just for her car, so I was like, okay, well, I have to call in.\n[03:34] [Receptionist]: Okay. Understood. And and what city, um, did this happen in?\n[03:39] [Danika Wilson]: Denton, Texas.\n[03:41] [Receptionist]: In Denton, okay.\n[03:44] [Receptionist]: All righty, give me one brief moment then, ma'am.

Um, but it was just for my daughter. Um, I don't know if she told you everything or do I need to explain it again?\n[06:29] [Receptionist]: Yeah, no, I'm going to go ahead and get the initial information, um, from you. What is your first and last name?\n[06:37] [Danika Wilson]: It's Danika Wilson. It's D as in David, E-A-N-I-K-A.\n[06:47] [Receptionist]: Awesome. And is this number, um, see here, ends in 691, what's a good callback number for you?\n[06:58] [Danika Wilson]: Uh, 214-356-0691.\n[07:04] [Receptionist]: Awesome. And you said calling on behalf of your daughter?\n[07:11] [Danika Wilson]: Yes.\n[07:13] [Receptionist]: Okay. And what is her first name?\n[07:17] [Danika Wilson]: It's Ray-Anna McDonald.\n[07:22] [Receptionist]: Okay. And will you spell her first name for me, that way I just make sure I have it correct?\n[07:32] [Danika Wilson]: It's R-A-Y-A-N-N-A, McDonald.\n[07:38] [Receptionist]: Perfect. And is she a minor or an adult?\n[07:42] [Danika Wilson]: Um, well, the wreck she was a minor, but now she's, she just turned 18, so...\n[07:50] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let's see here. And what's a good number to contact her at?\n[07:56] [Danika Wilson]: Uh, the, they can call this one or...\n[08:02] [Receptionist]: Are you going to be the main point of contact?\n[08:05] [Danika Wilson]: Yes.\n[08:07] [Receptionist]: Okay, we will leave you under here then. And what's a good email address for you then?\n[08:12] [Danika Wilson]: Uh, 1986danika@gmail.com.\n[08:27] [Receptionist]: Okay. And what date did this accident happen on?\n[08:33] [Danika Wilson]: Um, it was in November 8th. It was like a while back. But, um, well, there was four of them in the car, um, so this whole time it's just miscommunication pretty much. Um, I thought that the car that they were in that, um, like she had everything, like I thought she had her own lawyer and we would just like go through like just under her pretty much, but I didn't know we had to call separately, so I was like, okay. So they had told her that, um, that they were wanting to settle, um, because she's already admitted fault, but I just didn't know if I needed to speak with someone beforehand or just, you know, if that makes sense.\n[09:21] [Receptionist]: Yeah, we can definitely see. Um, and so you said there was four passengers in the vehicle with her?\n[09:28] [Danika Wilson]: Yes. Well, four in total, yes.\n[09:32] [Receptionist]: Okay. And it was a friend driving the vehicle or a friend's vehicle?\n[09:38] [Danika Wilson]: Correct. Yeah, the friend's mother's vehicle.\n[09:43] [Receptionist]: Okay. And where did they have this accident at?\n[09:46] [Danika Wilson]: Here in Denton. And she has it on video as well. Um, a car behind them was, um, driving and his dashcam caught it.\n[10:01] [Receptionist]: Okay, let's see here. And do you know how the accident happened? What, um, kind of what went on?\n[10:06] [Danika Wilson]: It was, they were stopping, it was like they were crossing an intersection and the car ran the light.\n[10:12] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let's see here. And you said that, um, they were at fault, correct?\n[10:28] [Danika Wilson]: Correct. Yeah, I have the, uh, report and their insurance, like all that information.\n[10:37] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, let's see here. Do you have that police report number at the moment?\n[10:43] [Danika Wilson]: Uh, at the moment, but I'm sure I can get it. Um, let me see, this might be it. Well, I have the actual insurance company, um, information that she gave, um, about that one.\n[11:06] [Receptionist]: Okay. Uh, what, what, um, what insurance carrier did the at-fault driver have?\n[11:16] [Danika Wilson]: Let's see, I'm on a lady over here and contact number, oh, here, um...\n[11:30] [Danika Wilson]: Hold on, I'm sorry, she has over here contact number, well, they just gave her a contact number and her name and...\n[11:46] [Danika Wilson]: Well, she just gave me the claim of loss number, so I don't know if that links to that, but...\n[11:52] [Receptionist]: Okay. No, but you know that both of the vehicles had, um, insurance?\n[11:57] [Danika Wilson]: Correct.\n[11:59] [Receptionist]: Okay. And, um, as far as your daughter having any injuries, um, can you kind of let me know how she's feeling there, what injuries she faced?\n[12:10] [Danika Wilson]: Yeah, she had, um, her wrist, it was, uh, like she had smashed up against the door when the impact, and they had, um, she had her wrist, her, like headaches she was having, and she had, um, I'd have to read the paper, I'm trying to remember. Um, it was like her wrist, her back injuries, and, um, yeah, those three things.\n[12:47] [Receptionist]: Okay. And is she still getting any treatment or has she been getting treatment at all?\n[12:54] [Danika Wilson]: Yeah, she's been having to go. Um, we just make a schedule because sometimes like her hand hurts, like she can't move it sometimes, it'll like stiffen up. She's been having really bad headaches, like she don't sleep, and sometimes she's having to miss school because of that, but, um, her primary doctor, she's prescribed her like over-the-counter medicine and also like, um, like some prescriptions as well.\n[13:29] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let's see here. And the initial time of the, uh, accident, um, did she go with the ambulance to the ER or did you guys go to the ER on your own?\n[13:42] [Danika Wilson]: No, we went on our own. Um, they didn't send the, uh, emergency, yeah.\n[13:48] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[13:59] [Receptionist]: And I know you mentioned the other people having an attorney. Um, do they have a different attorney or do you know if they signed with us?\n[14:07] [Danika Wilson]: No, um, I don't think she had one, like she didn't, I don't think she found an attorney. I thought she was going to, but she was just like, she just filed a claim for her loss, um, for her car, if that makes sense.\n[14:21] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let's see here. Okay, so what I'm going to do for you is I'm going to go ahead and, um, put you on a brief hold. I'm going to see if we have an attorney available that's, uh, going to be able to go ahead and speak with you, okay?\n[14:39] [Danika Wilson]: Okay.\n[14:41] [Receptionist]: Yeah, give me just a moment.\n[14:44] [Danika Wilson]: Okay.\n[14:45] [ ... Silence (237s) ... ]\n[18:43] [Drake Pew]: Hi, Ms. Wilson. This is Drake Pew, one of the attorneys at the McCraw Law Group. How are you doing today?\n[18:49] [Danika Wilson]: Hey, I'm doing good.\n[18:51] [Drake Pew]: Good, good. Trying to stay warm?\n[18:53] [Danika Wilson]: Yeah, pretty much, trying. Looking at this snow out here, I'm like, ooh, kind of crazy.\n[19:04] [Drake Pew]: Right, right. Absolutely. Well, I wish that we were meeting under some better circumstances, and Salen was telling me a little bit about what has happened to your daughter, and I'm, I'm sorry that she's going through all this. You know, I'm glad that she's working on getting better, but I just wanted to get on the phone with you, be a resource for you, answer any questions that you may have about potentially pursuing a personal injury case with your daughter. So feel free to ask me any questions that you have kind of right off the bat.\n[19:36] [Danika Wilson]: Okay. Um, I'm just, I'm just trying to find, you know, people who handled injuries, people minors, or well, once she turned 18 though, but she was a minor, I don't know if that matters. But, um, yeah, like the, like ongoing symptoms she had, um, like later on, it was like after the wreck, but like she's been going to the doctor as well. It was just like her headaches and her wrist, and like she's having like stomach issues as well, but they just give her like, um, like over-the-counter, over-the-counter medicines and, um, uh-huh. She has like everything like documented and stuff, but it's just, I'm not really sure what to do because like they want to settle and I'm like, why you want to settle so fast? But at the same time, I'm like, I always hear call a lawyer because you may be missing out, so I'm just like, just trying to cross all my T's, dot my I's, if that makes sense.\n[20:43] [Drake Pew]: Right, right. So the most important thing right now, and what you've already been doing, is just making sure that we get her healthy again. That's number one most important thing. Just got to make sure that she's going to make a 100% recovery. And part of what we do is, I know she's been having treatment already, but if she needs additional treatment, if she needs additional imaging, if she needs a second opinion, we're happy to get her set up with some additional providers as well that are going to see her quickly, going to get her the best care that we can get her to make sure that she is going to get back to 100%. The second thing that we do is make sure that we step in and start handling those conversations with the insurance company to make sure that they're not going to take advantage of her, not make sure that y'all aren't going to fall into a bad deal because at the same time, you know, these insurance companies, they're going to try and get you to settle quickly without knowing the full extent of her injuries, the full extent of the medical bills that are associated with those injuries. You know, they're going to try and get you to take a deal that's going to almost leave you kind of holding the bill. Yep, right, right. So part of our job's to handle all those communications, make sure that I'm getting her the biggest value that I can, but I can't know what the value of her case is until she's fully done her treatment, until I see all the medical bills that she's accumulated, and then just, you know, hearing a little bit about her, about the overall pain and suffering she's had to endure going through an incident like this. Once we do get to that, that's when we do start negotiating, and then once I get them to a number that I believe is going to be fair for her, I'll give y'all a call, we'll talk about the breakdown, we'll talk about what the attorney's fees would be, the case expenses, and paying back medical bills and how much would ultimately end up going in her pocket. And I'll let y'all know whether or not I think it's a fair deal. If they're not giving her a fair deal, that's the time that we gear up and potentially file a lawsuit. But two important things to keep in mind is, one, we would never file a lawsuit without y'all's permission, and two, we would never settle her case without her permission, okay? And then I want to make sure I'm being transparent with you about how we get paid. So we work on a contingency fee basis, meaning we only get paid if we recover. If for some reason there's no recovery, she does not owe us a dime. There's no upfront fees, no retainer fees, anything like that. Now, if we are able to get a recovery in what's called the pre-suit phase, meaning that we did not have to file a lawsuit, then the fee structure is one-third of the gross recovery plus any case expenses. And you'll find that that number's pretty customary throughout the personal injury field. But let's say in the event, you know, they're not giving her a fair deal and we do end up having to file a lawsuit, then the fee structure would increase to 40% simply because then we're in the court system. We'd be filing motions, we're taking depositions, we're going the whole nine yards, hence the increase there. And I know I'm throwing a lot of information at you. What questions can I answer?\n[23:52] [Danika Wilson]: I mean, well, you answered them actually along the way because like the fees, you already answered that. Um, communication, like all that, just, um, yeah, you pretty much answered most of my questions just within that little statement itself, so...\n[24:12] [Drake Pew]: That's what I try to do. I try to get it all out there.\n[24:15] [Danika Wilson]: Yeah, you hit it on the head.\n[24:18] [Drake Pew]: The most important, the most important thing, like I said, is making sure that we're getting her healthy again, and you know, if she needs to get set up with those additional appointments, that's what we're going to step in and assist with. So as of right now, you know, I'd love to get it moving and get her signed up, but obviously there's a lot, you have to talk to her and make sure it's something that she wants to do. Um, so in terms of next steps, I have two options. One, if you'd like to come meet us in person at some point, we can get her signed up in person, or because of, you know, the weather right now, I can send everything via DocuSign and get everything signed up electronically as well, but whatever y'all's preference is.\n[24:59] [Danika Wilson]: Yeah, I mean, DocuSign's fine for now, especially since the weather, because, yeah, I don't know about driving anywhere, we're kind of stuck, so we can't move.\n[25:11] [Drake Pew]: Right, right. Yep. And then so those forms that I'm going to send, they'll be in her name, and then she needs to be the one to sign them since she is 18 now, she is technically an adult, okay? But if you, if she wants to give us permission to speak with you about the case, you can be, you know, kind of the, the contact, if you will, for her case.\n[25:33] [Danika Wilson]: Okay. All right, I can do that.\n[25:36] [Drake Pew]: Perfect. Any other questions or just general concerns about moving forward?\n[25:42] [Danika Wilson]: Um, I'm, I'm loving everything. Just you touched all the bases, very informative.\n[25:51] [Drake Pew]: Absolutely. Well, here's the thing. I'll tell you right now, you're going to have questions as we go through the process. When you have questions or concerns, just give us a call. We'll pick up the phone, we'll talk about it.

How are you doing?\n[00:43] [Kathy Powell]: I'm good. How are you?\n[00:45] [Receptionist]: I'm doing good. Thank you for asking. Um, Ms. Jessica let me know, um, that you feel as though you're not too injured in this incident. Is that correct?\n[00:58] [Kathy Powell]: I'm not injured at all. No. I'm not. Yeah, other than the fact that they found a little something on my thyroid, but, you know, that didn't, uh, didn't come from the accident, so.\n[01:12] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I know I've spoken with Joe a couple of times. I haven't spoken directly with you. Um, but for the incident, he let me know to send some documents out to your email. Um, but if, but if you, you know, feel like you are not injured as a result of this accident and you're not looking to seek any other treatment, um, for the accident itself, I can void those documents out. You let me know how you're feeling, but if, if there's any part of you at all that, you know, is feeling different after the accident or if you want to speak more with an attorney to let you know how we can help you out, you let me know what you feel would be the best path for you.\n[01:57] [Kathy Powell]: Okay. Yeah, I'm, I'm just, I'm good, you know, or I guess I saw it coming and was just kind of braced for it or, or thought, uh, this is coming and I didn't have time to say anything about it, but, you know, it just, it didn't affect me like it did Joe. And, uh, our grandson, it didn't affect him any either, but, uh, it was Joe. Of course, he already had a back that's been bothering him for years, so that just aggravated it. And he's still having problems with it. But yet they haven't been able to find anything, so anyway.\n[02:38] [Receptionist]: I see. Okay. Well, you know, I'm glad to hear that, you know, it didn't affect you. If anything changes within the next few weeks or so, feel free to let us know. Um, you know, whenever there is an accident like this, we want to avoid any major gaps in treatment. So if you feel, if you start to feel anything, if anything changes, let us know as soon as possible, um, because there is a certain time limit from when we would have to start you into treatment for it to not affect your case. Um, but thank you for, for giving me a call back and let, letting me know. I know I hadn't spoken with you just yet, I've been communicating with, um, Joe. But I'll let our attorneys know. Um, you know, I'm glad to hear that you and your grandson were not affected by this, but if anything changes, feel free to give us a call back and let us know.\n[03:27] [Kathy Powell]: Okay. I do have a question though. I've been getting a lot of calls from Asian people on this accident. There's not one that's called me that is an American.\n[03:45] [Receptionist]: Oh, I see.\n[03:47] [Kathy Powell]: And they're just bugging me, bugging me. And I'm not, we've not received any kind of communications from Progressive at all.\n[04:00] [Receptionist]: I see. Um, so what may be happening there with getting different calls from different people. So we've taken over all communications with the insurance company in regards to Joe's claim. Um, so, so that's normal for Joe not to be communicating with anybody just in regards to his bodily injury claim. We've taken over all those communications so he doesn't have to worry about that. Um, but in regards to other people or other agencies or, um, entities giving you guys a call, sometimes what we, what we see is, unfortunately, when people are involved in an accident like this is, um, they get a lot of calls from what we call ambulance chasers. It's people who sit there and purchase police reports over and over to get people's information to see who was involved in a car accident and they start spamming them with calls, um, which is unfortunately not illegal in the state of Texas, um, but it is unethical and, um, I would, I would just let them know that, you know, what they're doing is unethical and they should not be reaching out to you purchasing your information and, and bothering you with spam calls. But it is what I want to say is most likely spam.\n[05:20] [Kathy Powell]: Yeah, probably. Because it pops up on my phone scam alert, you know. And they're never, it's always a Chinese type name, you know. I'm going, \"How come I'm not hearing from Progressive?\", you know. \"How come, how come it's always somebody from out of country and it's never, uh, from here in the states or...\"\n[05:48] [Receptionist]: Oh no. And I'm so sorry, you know, that you've had to go through that. So, so we've taken over all communications with the insurance company, so it's normal to not be hearing from them on Joe's claim. Um, and if Joe hears from them, it should be just in regards to the vehicle, um, as we've taken over all communication for the bodily injury. Um, but unfortunately these ambulance chasers, they do exist. They do sit there and purchase your information. Um, but most recently we've been made aware that the Texas Department of Transportation is doubling down on this and they're, they're making police reports harder to purchase. You have to go through a verification process. Um, so, so for people not to receive so much spam anymore and their information getting out after they've been in a car accident. So hopefully, you know, that should help. Um, but again, I'm so sorry that, you know, you've been experiencing that. Those spam, spam calls can be pesky.\n[06:45] [Kathy Powell]: Yeah. Well, so what do we do about, uh, the, uh, adjusters? Because we haven't heard anything, well, we did from USAA, which is our insurance, but of course they said, \"Well, we'll be out there Saturday.\" Well, it was, you know, the storm came in on Saturday, so I don't know if they came out before that or not, but Progressive sure not, has not reached out to us at all about the vehicle.\n[07:20] [Receptionist]: Okay. About the vehicle. Okay. Let me, let me go ahead and send a message to your, to Joe's case manager, Crystal. Um, I'm the intake supervisor here at the McCraw Law Group, so I see like the oversee, the onboarding of your cases, but Ms. Crystal will have, since she is his assigned paralegal, she'll have more visibility on exactly what's going on with the insurances and where they're at and she'll be able to assist him with any communications in regards to the property damage and getting the vehicle evaluated. So I can go ahead and send her a message and have her reach back out to you guys to give you more of an update on exactly what's going on.\n[07:59] [Kathy Powell]: Okay, that'd be great. I just, just call Joe on that.\n[08:04] [Receptionist]: Okay. Yeah, she certainly has his number. I'll go ahead and send her a message so she can reach out as soon as possible and get the ball rolling for you guys on at least the, the vehicle portion as well.\n[08:16] [Kathy Powell]: Yes. Okay, that'd be great.\n[08:18] [Receptionist]: All right. Thank you for speaking with me, Kathy. You guys take care, stay warm, stay safe.\n[08:23] [Kathy Powell]: Yep, you too.\n[08:24] [Receptionist]: All right, have a good one.

Mhm. You know, and when I talked to the service guy, he was like, \"Misty, we do that for everybody.\" He's like, \"It's a common courtesy, you know, we top off your fluids. That's part of an oil change.\" And I was like, \"That's what I thought.\"\n[02:27] [Receptionist]: Yeah, that's very—\n[02:28] [Misty Vick]: So, yeah.\n[02:31] [Receptionist]: Let me see who would be your best point of contact for this. Um, I don't believe we have a specific attorney to refer you to, however I can give you the phone number to the Dallas Bar Association. They're a free referral service. Um, they'll just provide you a list of attorneys after hearing your case and what's going on, um, of attorneys that could help you out and that are closest to your area. I know you were looking for an Amarillo attorney, um, so they would definitely be able to provide that information for you if you wanted to give them a call.\n[03:02] [Misty Vick]: Okay.\n[03:04] [Receptionist]: Let me know whenever you're ready for that phone number.\n[03:07] [Misty Vick]: Go ahead.\n[03:08] [Receptionist]: It's gonna be 214-220-7400.\n[03:13] [Misty Vick]: 220-7400.\n[03:17] [Receptionist]: Yes.\n[03:18] [Misty Vick]: Dallas Bar Association Law Line.\n[03:25] [Receptionist]: Well, I wish you the best of luck with this and I hope you have a nice day.\n[03:31] [Misty Vick]: Um, thank you.

Hey. What's up?\n[00:05] SPEAKER 2: Hey. Okay. So on this I'm looking at Delfino.\n[00:10] SPEAKER 1: So Give just a moment. Let me if I pull it up. It was just at lunch.\n[00:15] SPEAKER 2: Okay. Oh,\n[00:21] SPEAKER 1: yes. It's almost the exact same report, if I'm remembering correctly, just with\n[00:25] SPEAKER 2: Where is there another report with the semi truck driver somewhere? That's I think that's what we were waiting on. Right?\n[00:33] SPEAKER 1: That's what he doesn't know because the semi is it was a hit and run. He doesn't know if anything was ever found on them.\n[00:44] SPEAKER 2: Okay. Well, the deceased is Unit 1. We'll just be able to look up that guy's name and see if there's another police report attached to it. You know what I mean?\n[00:57] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. He's told me that he told me that the DPS officer told him he would not be able to retrieve anybody else's report except for his own.\n[01:06] SPEAKER 2: Oh, maybe there's a for maybe there's a criminal investigation going on. Probably.\n[01:10] SPEAKER 1: So he got in contact with Luis this for the second report, the friend that he made, and Luis retrieved his own report and gave it to him. Okay.\n[01:22] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Well, we have access to Chris again. So I what I would do is this. I would go search Louis the the deceased name, who is Tuan Coroz, and see\n[01:36] SPEAKER 1: Do you have access or only Linda? Do you know? Do need a general account?\n[01:41] SPEAKER 2: She'll probably have the login if you just wanna ask her for it. And I will just go see what that's if there's a because he would technically probably be on the deceased. We're probably on, like, three police reports. You know? One for Mhmm.\n[01:54] SPEAKER 2: The semi, one for Luis, and one for Delfino. I would assume they're saying it's three separate events. And then but the thing is if there's an active criminal investigation going on right now against the semi, then they might not have released the semi police report.\n[02:15] SPEAKER 1: You know\n[02:15] SPEAKER 2: what I mean?\n[02:16] SPEAKER 1: Okay. Yeah. He doesn't know anything else going on with the semi, but I do see on the withdrawal letter that his previous attorney isn't retaining an interest.\n[02:30] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. The issue is He's nice guy. My my issue is I'm pretty sure and why I wanna be careful about this one. I'm pretty sure that Delfino is probably the one that actually, you know, might kill this guy. And Yeah.\n[02:45] SPEAKER 2: That's a really, really bad fact for us. So I just wanna be careful and have all the information before I make a decision. And I'm not saying it was his fault. You know what I mean?\n[02:56] SPEAKER 1: Mhmm.\n[02:56] SPEAKER 2: But I I wanna see what we're dealing with and what the other reports say. Because they if they're on the tool way, they they probably pulled footage with a death. So that's where I'm at right now.\n[03:09] SPEAKER 1: K. Let me look. And then October 21. I don't trying to look on Chris as if I was, like, the name of the deceased, as if I was purchasing my own police report.\n[03:36] SPEAKER 2: Right.\n[03:36] SPEAKER 1: But it says nothing nothing is available. Like, not I don't even see the other two.\n[03:42] SPEAKER 2: Oh, weird. Alberto. How that how that not pop up? I mean, that's weird. 10/2125.\n[03:55] SPEAKER 2: Juan Carlos. Carlos. And it's weird they're all separated.\n[04:05] SPEAKER 1: It's like a. Mhmm.\n[04:07] SPEAKER 2: Should be one event.\n[04:08] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. I don't even see I don't even see the other two. That's so weird. Under the looking at the deceased name.\n[04:25] SPEAKER 2: Right. I don't know, Kim. I don't know. This one scares me. Let's let's just table it till intake level 10, and then we'll go from Okay.\n[04:41] SPEAKER 1: Alright. Gloria might join us in Elton tomorrow,\n[04:44] SPEAKER 2: she said. She cannot. Because\n[04:47] SPEAKER 1: she told me why there's there's a 115 leads, and only five were wanted last week. Isn't that crazy?\n[05:00] SPEAKER 2: Well, that's what that's what they told us. That it would be like. So alrighty. Yeah. We'll figure it out.\n[05:08] SPEAKER 2: Do\n[05:10] SPEAKER 1: you hear us anybody if we're\n[05:11] SPEAKER 2: gonna be in in the office tomorrow? Do have any idea? I haven't yet. Nearby? Okay.\n[05:16] SPEAKER 2: Sounds good.\n[05:17] SPEAKER 1: But if you hear if you talk to anyone and they happen even any attorney, and they happen to go into the office later or they happen to be there, let me know. I need someone to take a look at our handheld office phones up front because I don't know if the girls mess with the settings, but our calls are, like, delaying.\n[05:38] SPEAKER 2: Oh, like, they're not going directly to y'all? Yeah. Uh-oh. Okay.\n[05:43] SPEAKER 1: So if you happen to hear of anybody being there, let me know.\n[05:46] SPEAKER 2: Okay. I would and for that re I would just send something in the general chat, like, the McRoll chat and say, hey. Is anybody in the office that can help assist me with something? I would probably ask. You know what I mean?\n[05:59] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. I just don't want them to be like, what's going on? And then freak out about\n[06:03] SPEAKER 2: Oh, no. I hear you. I know. I know.\n[06:05] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. Because we are getting them. They're just delayed, or we're having, like, to call people right back.\n[06:13] SPEAKER 2: Weird. Okay. Yeah. Just I'll I'll let you know if I hear about anybody that that's in there, but I don't think anybody is there.\n[06:20] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. I don't think so either. Like, if anybody Suzanne would be there, and I thought Emily and they're not there. So I'm like, yeah. Probably nobody.\n[06:26] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Okay. Sounds good.\n[06:28] SPEAKER 1: Alright.

Uh, Carla, I apologize, it seems that I would need to take a message for you at this time. Uh, but don't worry, I'll make sure to pass it over to the appropriate team right away so they can verify this client's details for you. Uh, do you have an email where they could follow up with you or your phone number is fine?\n[02:31] [Karla]: Um, the phone number is fine, um, but you do have her in the sys— in your system. 'Cause we have a request from you guys and we just wanted to confirm.\n[02:41] [Receptionist]: Yeah, definitely. Well, since I'm the receptionist, for privacy of the cases, I don't have access to the files. So I'm not able to confirm it myself. Sorry. Uh, but I'll make sure the legal team reviews this as soon as they can and I'll pass it along side your phone number so they can follow up with you, okay?\n[02:56] [Karla]: Okay. And what is your name?\n[02:58] [Receptionist]: Yes, my name is Edgar. That's E-D like David-G-A-R.\n[03:04] [Karla]: Okay, so when they call me back, they need a reference number. Let me give you that number.\n[03:09] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[03:10] [Karla]: It's 25-083832.\n[03:17] [Receptionist]: Okay. Perfect. And I'll go ahead and pass this over alongside the reference number, okay?\n[03:22] [Karla]: All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n[03:24] [Receptionist]: Have a good day.

Only thing I did was fill out paperwork, sit in the waiting room, they took my height and weight, and asked me where I was hurting, and they did an X-ray of my back. And other than that, um, that was it. But they wanted me to come to therapy five times a week and I can't do that.\n[03:25] [Receptionist]: I understand. I understand. So, five times a week.\n[03:33] [Keonte Reese]: Yeah, and the lawyer told me, um, no, if I wanted a settlement, uh, I would have to go for those five times a week. And I was just letting him know, you know, like, you know, with having a job and things of that sort, kids, you know, I can't just up and go there every day. You know, so it was a problem.

All right. And then you were saying, um, it was about a ticket and there was something else also?\n[01:58] [Eric Degler]: Yeah, well there was something else I forgot to do. Um, what the judge is asking for is a copy of liability insurance valid on date citation was issued. Well, that's what the ticket was for because I didn't have insurance at that time.\n[02:14] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay. I gotcha. So yeah, you don't have a way to—\n[02:17] [Eric Degler]: He's actually even thanked me for making his job easy.\n[02:22] [Receptionist]: Yeah. So—\n[02:24] [Eric Degler]: I mean, I try to keep my composure on things like that.\n[02:28] [Receptionist]: I gotcha. And sir, we got a couple different locations. Um, are you closer to Dallas or Amarillo?\n[02:45] [Eric Degler]: Oh, I am in Valle de Oro.\n[02:52] [Receptionist]: Okay. Is that— sorry, is that closer to Dallas or Amarillo?\n[02:56] [Eric Degler]: Hmm?\n[02:57] [Receptionist]: So would that be—\n[03:01] [Receptionist]: Because I'm just trying to figure out which, which office to put this in. So are you, are you better off in Dallas or Amarillo?\n[03:07] [Eric Degler]: I think I'm better off in Amarillo for the moment, but the court case is in Abernathy.\n[03:14] [Receptionist]: Abernathy. Okay. Yeah, I mean we can cover the whole state, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n[03:21] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Well, I'm— well, that's good to know. I needed to hear that. Um, I live on Tascosa Road. I'm closer to Boys Ranch than I am to Amarillo. I'm stuck right in between the two.\n[03:41] [Eric Degler]: I'm supposed to show up on March 26th, 2026 at 9:30 AM.\n[03:51] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[03:52] [Eric Degler]: Justice of the Peace located on I-27 and Farm Market 54 in Abernathy. I paid the ticket. I was on time with that. And I guess I was under the illusion that that was going to be it. You pay it and that's the end of it. But then she knows I have insurance, but she wants copy of the liability insurance, which I still have and maintained it since.\n[04:26] [Receptionist]: And sir, where did you say the ticket was from?\n[04:29] [Eric Degler]: Abernathy.\n[04:31] [Receptionist]: Abernathy.\n[04:33] [Eric Degler]: Straight down 27. It's not that far south of Canyon. Well, it is and it isn't, all according to your perspective on that, I guess.\n[04:46] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[04:56] [Eric Degler]: And $144 state fee cashier's check or money order. Affidavit signed and notarized copy of driver's license record.\n[05:09] [Receptionist]: Okay. So sir, for these issues, um, because I'm just going through the intake process here, so at this time we're not taking cases for, for traffic tickets right now. So I got a number I can refer you to though that will be able to help you.\n[05:28] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Yeah, that would help. I don't like going into court without representation.\n[05:33] [Receptionist]: Yeah, let me give you this number. Um, this'll— you'll be able to— yeah, we're just— I'm sorry about that. Yeah, we're just not doing the traffic cases right now. Um, but yeah, let me know when you're ready for that number.\n[05:45] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Yeah, I am.\n[05:49] [Receptionist]: So that is 214-220-7400.\n[05:56] [Eric Degler]: 214. Where is that?\n[05:58] [Receptionist]: I'm not sure exactly where that is, but—\n[06:02] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I'm not sure exactly what area code that is.\n[06:05] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Okay. Could you give me that number again, please?\n[06:09] [Receptionist]: Yeah, 214-220-7400.\n[06:19] [Eric Degler]: 7400. And who would that be for?\n[06:23] [Receptionist]: That's for the Dallas Bar Association. So they can, they can refer you to a lawyer that's taking the, uh, traffic cases right now.\n[06:32] [Eric Degler]: Oh. Okay. Maybe you can answer me a question. Um, there's a lawyer I used to use all the time. I went down to his office, but the only thing that's left there is the building. Uh, Ronald Spriggs?\n[06:52] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I'm not— I'm not sure who that is.\n[06:56] [Eric Degler]: Well, he's a local lawyer here in Amarillo.\n[07:01] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I guess he's— maybe he closed up shop. I'm not sure.\n[07:06] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Well, that's what I was thinking. I called him— I've called him a few times, never gotten an answer. Then one day he called me back, said call me back. And I've been trying ever since and still can't reach him. He did talk about moving to Maryland.\n[07:24] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I was going to say maybe he moved. Yeah, maybe. I'm not sure.\n[07:29] [Eric Degler]: Mhm.\n[07:30] [Receptionist]: All right, sir. Well, thanks for calling in and, uh—\n[07:36] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. The way the country's going right now, it's fucking scary.\n[07:41] [Receptionist]: Oh yeah. No, it's crazy right now.\n[07:45] [Eric Degler]: Yeah, well Jesse Ventura put it perfectly. He says we are a third world country now. Not only that, but, you know, this whole thing that with ICE and all that.\n[08:01] [Eric Degler]: He said look at Nazi Germany during the 1930s. That's what— that's what we're doing. And I, being a history buff, I couldn't disagree with that. But World War II is not my strong suit. The Civil War is my strong suit. You know.\n[08:19] [Receptionist]: Yeah. All right, sir. Well, give that number a call. They'll be able to get it figured out for you and, uh, yeah, thanks for calling in and, uh, have a great day, okay?\n[08:29] [Eric Degler]: Mhm.\n[08:31] [Receptionist]: All right. Bye-bye now, sir.\n[08:33] [Eric Degler]: They'll be able to help out with someone here in Amarillo or possibly even Abernathy, I guess.\n[08:41] [Receptionist]: That's the bar, so I mean, yeah, they'll have— they got, you know, contact info for attorneys all over the state.\n[08:48] [Eric Degler]: Okay. And what is it called again? The Dallas Bar?\n[08:52] [Receptionist]: Dallas Bar Association.\n[08:56] [Eric Degler]: Okay.\n[08:57] [Receptionist]: All right, sir. Well, thanks for calling in and, uh, have a good day.\n[09:03] [Eric Degler]: I've been fighting the government all day over my retirement. They offer you things, they talk to you about things, oh you qualify this, you qualify that, and then you find out after a couple hours that you never actually were qualified for anything. It's a real mess this retirement. It's not what people think it is. Trust you me.\n[09:26] [Receptionist]: Yeah. What I'm looking to do is just get this—\n[09:28] [Eric Degler]: Ticket taken care of without having to show up there 9:30 in the morning. Um—\n[09:38] [Receptionist]: I understand. And I'm sorry we couldn't be more help for you. I'm going to have to let you go though, sir. I got a lot of calls on hold here.\n[09:45] [Eric Degler]: Okay.\n[09:47] [Receptionist]: Have a good one.\n[09:48] [Eric Degler]: Yep.

Um, I am just call testing. I think Zade was just able to fix our phones.\n[00:13] [Receptionist]: Oh, slay. Thank you. Awesome. All right, so it worked, call came through and everything?\n[00:18] [Kim]: Yep.\n[00:19] [Receptionist]: All right, cool. Thank you. I guess Zade had the power to do it, um, online this entire time. But yesterday I asked him, I'm like, \"Hey, let me know if you're in the office, I need help with the phones,\" and he, like, didn't tell me anything until today. He's like, \"Oh, actually I can help.\" Like, \"Oop, that would've— that would've been great to know yesterday.\" That's nice to know. All right, well, um, all right, let— since they are working, let me know if you need me for any calls. Gotcha. Um, and on that one that I, um, Eric Degler from Smith AI, since Smith AI rejected live on call, we don't have to send a, um, rejection message out. But if you could just update that lead on Salesforce to the rejected status and then it'll ask— ask for a reject reason and then reject description. And you can just say, you know, Smith AI rejected due to XYZ, outside of off— um, sorry, outside of practice area or rejected due to, you know, whatever the reason is.\n[01:31] [Kim]: Gotcha.\n[01:32] [Receptionist]: And then it'll ask you to fill in— fill in where they were referred out to and that's where you would add the Dallas Bar.\n[01:42] [Kim]: Okay.\n[01:45] [Receptionist]: And he will probably be sitting in the new column.\n[01:49] [Kim]: I found him. Mm-hmm. Um, okay, so entry and I put in the description rejected due to inquiring outside of practice area.\n[02:03] [Receptionist]: Yep. And then the reject status would be the same from the drop-down list.\n[02:10] [Kim]: Mm-hmm. Yeah, got it.\n[02:15] [Receptionist]: Awesome. And then the only other thing I would adjust on those leads, if you can see whenever it's integrated on its own, um, it has the contact method as basically it should be flip-flopped. The contact method should— should be after hours and the lead source should be Google search. So we have to go in and adjust that.\n[02:37] [Kim]: [ ... Silence (11s) ... ] Google. Eh, there we go.\n[02:48] [Receptionist]: And then while you're in that section, if you would be able to add a home office, since he did Google search Amarillo, his home office would be Amarillo. Or his closest location.\n[03:01] [Kim]: So for, um, Google search Amarillo?\n[03:06] [Receptionist]: Mm-hmm. Since he's in that area. Um, and also home office would be Amarillo.\n[03:14] [Kim]: [ ... Silence (19s) ... ] Okay. Wait, is that, um, oh, is it asking for the home office, is that portion after you, um, mark the status?\n[03:33] [Receptionist]: Um, yes. Well, no, not— it's right there underneath contact method.

Okay, now I understand you need help with... um... code violations you said? Would you mind just briefly describing what happened or how we can help you?\n[02:09] [Robert Harris]: Well, I have code violations in Sachse, I have code violations in Dallas, I have appeal process in Dallas, and I have some ADA violations that need to be addressed.\n[02:27] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, when you say code violations, do you mean... like...\n[02:33] [Robert Harris]: Outside storage, junk vehicles, they they want me to remove everything from my property.\n[02:41] [Receptionist]: Okay, gotcha. Um, may I ask how you heard about us?\n[02:45] [Robert Harris]: Uh, just did internet search for attorneys in close my area and you're in Wylie which is not too far and it seemed like you didn't specialize in a particular, you know, injury or family or whatever that I could see but uh it seemed like that uh possibly uh this firm could help me.\n[03:21] [Receptionist]: Okay, gotcha. So I just want to confirm, has anyone been injured?\n[03:26] [Robert Harris]: No. It's nothing to do with accidents like that, so no. I've had some in the past but that didn't help any either.\n[03:39] [Receptionist]: Okay.

I'm just trying to see how we can best assist. Would you mind just telling me briefly exactly what happened?\n[04:07] [Robert Harris]: [laughter] Again, it's it's pretty involved. Okay, so for city of Sachse, uh, not sure how long ago it was, I get uh code officers come out, they get a warrant, they uh give me tickets for outside storage, I go to city court, of course that was useless, they they found against me, I get fines and uh then they uh come out uh another warrant, uh threaten me with more fines and they want to abate uh everything from my property and so that's in process. I do not have citation with them right now but they uh obviously uh will continue. In city of Dallas, um, same thing, citations, warrants, came out, gone to court, gone against me and I am trying to do an appeal process and I need help with it. So at a minimum would be somebody expert in appeal process to give me some help.\n[05:28] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. Okay, so we would be unable to assist with that. I do have the number for the Dallas Bar Association, they'll be able to give you—\n[05:37] [Robert Harris]: No they won't help. No they won't. So thank you very much. Is there nobody local here, Sachse or Wylie?\n[05:43] [Receptionist]: I don't have a a referral at this time, I do apologize.\n[05:49] [Robert Harris]: Can you ask any lawyers in your firm and give me a call back?\n[05:56] [Receptionist]: I will let them know you asked.

I internally manage the McCalla Law Group Google Ads account internally, I'm the AM, and I talked to someone named Paola, like I said, maybe a week or two ago and she mentioned that that they would kind of pass along a message, but again, I was trying to just get in touch with someone on the marketing side. Any chance you can kind of just help me understand who I should be talking to from just a little bit of what I know is you're working with an agency called Studio 3, but I also see a different agency called R2 Media, so again, apologies for the left field call, but any way you can kind of direct me as to who I should maybe be talking to?\n[00:52] [Receptionist]: Yes, you're mentioned you spoke to Paola?\n[00:56] [Anthony]: Yeah.\n[00:57] [Receptionist]: Um, she's actually in our marketing department.\n[01:04] [Anthony]: Okay.\n[01:05] [Receptionist]: So—\n[01:06] [Anthony]: So do you suggest I talk with Paola or what what do you suggest? I just want to make sure I'm reaching the right person, yeah.\n[01:13] [Receptionist]: Well, uh, she would be the best person to talk to since she is, um, from the marketing department. Would you mind just holding a second for me, Anthony?\n[01:23] [Anthony]: Sure, no problem.\n[01:24] [Receptionist]: Thank you.\n[01:25] [ ... Silence (10s) ... ]\n[01:35] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for holding there, Anthony.

Um, that would be great. Um, do you want me to give you my number?\n[01:51] [Receptionist]: Yes, please.\n[01:52] [Anthony]: Okay. 415-736-0950.\n[02:01] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much. So just to confirm that was 415-736-0950?\n[02:08] [Anthony]: Yeah. And is is there a way to ensure I get a call back? Because I want to say last time they said someone, not you, but someone said something similar and I never got a call back. And I I just want to make sure I don't get lost in the loop. Like, is there anyone else I can speak to within the marketing department or would she be like the the person?\n[02:25] [Receptionist]: Uh, she'd be the primary, uh, person for the marketing team. Um, and I already forwarded over the your phone number and the message so that she can reach out to you.\n[02:35] [Anthony]: Okay. And, um, do you guys have like a a direct line, like, you know how like press the keypad for, you know, if you want to talk to XYZ or do you guys not do that?

And does she have an email as well?\n[02:54] [Receptionist]: Um... Unfortunately, I can't give you her email, but, um, yeah, she should be giving you a call back if anything.\n[03:02] [Anthony]: Okay, cool.

How are you?\n[00:10] [Receptionist]: I'm good, how are you doing?\n[00:12] [Betsy]: Good. I just wanted to check in with you guys. I know Janet was out of town and said, said that we could regroup this week and I had a couple of times that are available with one of our partners that you guys wanted to meet with. So I wanted to send that over and see if you guys have availability either tomorrow or Thursday to regroup.\n[00:30] [Receptionist]: I see. Um, let me see here. Janet, unfortunately, um, I know that she is kind of leading this project and she unfortunately got stuck. We are in Texas and in, in the ice storm. So she got stuck out of town and unfortunately won't be able to return until Friday, um, or so. Um, and then, let's see...\n[00:59] [Betsy]: Oh no, I'm so sorry. I know, I feel like the whole country got hit. We're in Chicago, so we're like kind of used to it, but I feel like everyone else shuts down. Like so many of my friends in the South had snow and like couldn't go outside.\n[01:14] [Receptionist]: Yeah, and we're actually, yeah, so she got, uh, stuck out, out of town, um, and she won't be on a flight back until Friday. And then we're actually out of the office due to the weather. Um, I believe we won't be back in the office until Thursday, it's looking like. Um, so we're all kind of just remote right now as well.\n[01:35] [Betsy]: Would you guys be able to join a call with a partner remote if we, if everybody dialed in? The only reason I'm asking is because our, our year end ends on the 31st, so, and I know that you guys were interested in taking advantage of the discount, which was much larger at the end of the year. So that's why we're kind of hustling to pull something together, um, if it's possible, because I'd rather give you guys the best price and prices go, you know, up after Jan 1 and the year resets.\n[02:05] [Receptionist]: Yeah. No, I understand. Let me, let me place you on a brief hold here, Betsy. Let me see what Zade's calendar is looking like.\n[02:16] [Betsy]: Okay. The times that I have open, if you want to check, are, um, 10:00 to 12:00 tomorrow. That's Cen— you guys are Central too, correct?\n[02:26] [Receptionist]: Correct.\n[02:27] [Betsy]: Yeah. Um, and then 11:00 to 1:00 on Thursday. And if those don't work and you see any other openings, just let me know and we can probably make it work.\n[02:36] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me just one moment. I'll place you on a brief hold here and let me check Zade's availability. Mm-hmm.\n[02:48] [Receptionist]: Hey Betsy, I'm sorry for that hold there.\n[02:51] [Betsy]: No worries. Learning all about customer testimonials there.\n[02:56] [Receptionist]: Um, I was able to check in with Zade. Um, he let me know that, yeah, since Janet won't be back until Friday or even next week or so, he thinks it would be best, and I also agree, I think it would be best to set up a meeting for maybe next week, if that's possible. I know that your end is coming up for you guys, but we just want to make sure, um, we take our time with the decision and are able to meet with, um, the partners, um, beforehand. So I think, you know, even if prices go up, I think we're, you know, we're just gonna have to roll with that and make the decision, um, with enough time. So maybe sometime next week would work for you guys?\n[03:38] [Betsy]: Yeah, totally. What, um, that's totally fine. I just obviously want to be transparent on like how we can make the, you know, the best deal for you guys, um, because I know this is a priority and I know that the smart, um, advocate integration is kind of a huge pain for you right now. So, um, but yeah, we can move it at whatever pace you guys, you guys need or, you know, whatever the partners are looking for. What works next week for you guys?\n[03:59] [Receptionist]: Let me pull that up here. Just one moment. So it looks like next week we are pretty open, um, Wednesday, Thursday, myself and Janet. And then if you're able to send the invite, I don't have access to Zade's, um, calendar, but he should be able to join.\n[04:26] [Betsy]: Okay. So Wednesday the 4th or Thursday the 5th. Do you have a preference? Like, what about 10:00 AM on Wednesday? Would that work?\n[04:34] [Receptionist]: That would actually work. I think Monday works perfect. I mean, sorry, 10:00 AM morning works perfect.\n[04:41] [Betsy]: Yeah, on, on February 4th.\n[04:43] [Receptionist]: Yes. Let me...\n[04:44] [Betsy]: Okay. I'm going to, I'll send you an invite. I'm going to, um, check with one— I know you guys wanted to meet with both partners, so I'll ping the partner and make sure that they're also available for that. And then once I have confirmation, um, is there a second slot available that you want to give me as a backup? Because I can propose that to, to the other partner and that way, I don't know if it'd be easier just meeting with, like, both partners in one day, um, so we could get that out of the way for you and, I don't know, the way my brain works, it's like easier, you have both options, they're fresh in your mind.\n[05:13] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Um, let me see. I mean, we're pretty open on, on Wednesday or Thursday.\n[05:23] [Betsy]: Okay. Um, let me see a couple options. How about, um, let me just looking here really quick. What about like, um, 11— uh, let's see, 11:00 on Wednesday the 4th for option two?\n[05:41] [Receptionist]: Yeah, 10:00 or 11:00.\n[05:42] [Betsy]: Okay. So I'll try to get them on— and they'd just be like quick 30 minutes, it'd probably be less. Um, but I will, I will follow up and you guys are all on that thread once I have confirmation and we can go from there. But, um, yeah, just if, you know, anything changes, I just want to make sure that we were upfront with you guys on, on the pricing and how it will be different, you know, starting next week.\n[06:05] [Receptionist]: Yeah, no, and I, yeah, I think we totally understand that. We just want to make sure we're, um, taking our time with the decision as well.\n[06:12] [Betsy]: Totally. Totally, totally. Okay, we'll move it whatever pace works for you guys, um, and we'll get the next call set up, you guys can meet with the partners, review, and then we'll go from there.\n[06:22] [Receptionist]: Okay, perfect.\n[06:23] [Betsy]: All right, Kimberly, it's nice talking to you. Stay warm and we'll talk soon.\n[06:27] [Receptionist]: You too. Stay safe.\n[06:28] [Betsy]: Okay, thanks so much.

Okay, and the incident, I see it happened in 20— February the 7th, 2025.\n[02:04] [Onre Wells]: Yes ma'am.\n[02:06] [Receptionist]: And so you were on a motorcycle.\n[02:08] [Onre Wells]: Yes ma'am. And something fell off of a semi and hit me in the face and knocked me out, from what I understand.\n[02:20] [Receptionist]: Is there a police report?\n[02:23] [Onre Wells]: I believe so. Um, there was a lot of cops there. I got a ticket for failure to maintain single lane and something else. But my memory, I can't remember, so I would have— we would have to look it up. I had insurance and everything like that.\n[02:48] [Receptionist]: Okay, so you got the ticket for what again? Did you get the ticket for the accident?\n[02:54] [Onre Wells]: Yes. Failure to maintain single lane, and I believe my tags were out.\n[03:05] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay. So you got the ticket for the accident. What were your injuries?\n[03:14] [Onre Wells]: I lost my left leg below the knee. I tore my quad in my right leg. I broke my elbow, broke my shoulder on the left side, broke both bones in my left arm, um... uh, bruised my sternum, crushed my left hand, it's permanently disfigured, um, broke some ribs.\n[03:49] [Receptionist]: Did the semi-truck— did they stop?\n[03:52] [Onre Wells]: No ma'am.\n[03:53] [Receptionist]: So the semi took off. I mean, didn't know. What is it that fell out of the semi, do you know?\n[04:01] [Onre Wells]: I have no idea, ma'am. All I know is it ripped my visor plumb off of my face and knocked me— I guess knocked me unconscious.\n[04:13] [Receptionist]: So, were you— you were behind the semi?\n[04:17] [Onre Wells]: Yes ma'am.\n[04:26] [Onre Wells]: I was in construction going between Skellytown and Pampa on Highway 152, and I couldn't pass them or anything like that. So whatever fell off of the truck or didn't— I— I don't know. I'm just going by what people told me. I don't remember that day.\n[04:54] [Receptionist]: Yeah. So, why do you think something hit you on the face?\n[05:01] [Onre Wells]: From— well, my visor was ripped off of my head and I can kind of remember some stuff, but I was told by a person behind me that they saw something come off or they saw what had happened.\n[05:26] [Receptionist]: Okay. Well, what I'm trying to understand is you got a— a ticket for change lane?\n[05:35] [Onre Wells]: Failure to maintain single lane.\n[05:38] [Receptionist]: Right. So, you— did you merge into somebody's lane?\n[05:44] [Onre Wells]: No ma'am. I— I went from the highway to the bar ditch, and that's how I got the ticket.\n[05:58] [Onre Wells]: They gave me a ticket for not staying in my lane.\n[06:02] [Receptionist]: Correct, correct. And in— in this accident, correct?\n[06:08] [Onre Wells]: Yes ma'am.\n[06:09] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me put you on hold. Did you already pay your ticket? Did you already pay your ticket?\n[06:15] [Onre Wells]: Yes ma'am. I— I didn't have much choice. I didn't know what else to do. And my insurance, they basically told me what I had was liability, the word, not liability with anything helping.\n[06:39] [Onre Wells]: That's honestly what they told me. I had the word liability, I didn't have anything extra.\n[06:47] [Receptionist]: Let me put you on hold. Let me speak with an attorney, okay?\n[06:52] [Onre Wells]: Yes ma'am.\n[06:53] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]\n[06:59] [Receptionist]: Okay, I'm sorry about that, Mr. Onre. Okay, I did speak with the attorney—\n[07:01] [Onre Wells]: No ma'am, no problem.\n[07:04] [Receptionist]: And I'm sorry, but this is not the type of case we are taking. Is there a reason you waited for a whole year?\n[07:11] [Onre Wells]: I— I spent quite a couple of months in the hospital, and I've kind of been battling with stuff.\n[07:22] [Receptionist]: Yes, I can imagine. I'm so sorry. But y'all— y'all aren't taking this kind of case?\n[07:28] [Receptionist]: No, I'm sorry. I did speak with the attorney. And also because you were cited for the accident.\n[07:38] [Onre Wells]: I was what, ma'am?\n[07:39] [Receptionist]: You were cited for the accident. Correct?\n[07:49] [Onre Wells]: Oh. Yes. Okay. So I got cited for the accident and that—\n[07:56] [Receptionist]: Go ahead.\n[07:57] [Onre Wells]: No, go ahead. Um, I'm just trying to figure out since I got a ticket because they didn't have anybody else to write a ticket to.\n[08:11] [Receptionist]: Right. Oh my gosh, that's crazy. Did you— after you— after something fell off the semi, did you— did you hit someone else or you don't— well, you don't remember?\n[08:22] [Onre Wells]: No ma'am. I hit the bar ditch and hit a sign and folded myself in half. I skidded my leg off first, though. I was trying to correct the bike.\n[08:35] [Receptionist]: Wow, I'm so sorry. Wow.\n[08:40] [Onre Wells]: Well, I mean, you live and learn.\n[08:45] [Receptionist]: I am so sorry, sir, you went through that. And thank you for calling. Are you still doing therapy and all that?\n[08:54] [Onre Wells]: No ma'am. Um, insurance didn't help me with anything, so I have to pay for everything out of pocket.\n[09:05] [Receptionist]: Oh, really? Oh my goodness. My goodness.\n[09:10] [Onre Wells]: So I still have a broken shoulder and a broken elbow and a torn quad, and I can't do anything about it.\n[09:20] [Receptionist]: Wow.\n[09:24] [Onre Wells]: I can't even walk on crutches. I'm stuck in a wheelchair.\n[09:28] [Receptionist]: Wow.\n[09:32] [Onre Wells]: But, you know, if a lawyer can't help me, then I guess I don't need help.\n[09:42] [Receptionist]: Well, we're not saying— would you like for me to give you the number to the State Bar of Texas? That's a list of attorneys. Would you like that number?\n[10:04] [Onre Wells]: Um, could you email it to me? I don't have anything to write with. Do you have my email address?\n[10:10] [Receptionist]: I do.\n[10:11] [Onre Wells]: That would be amazing of you.\n[10:14] [Receptionist]: Okay. That would— I will do that, Onre. Thank you so much. You take care of yourself.\n[10:19] [Onre Wells]: Thank you. You too, ma'am. Have a good day.\n[10:22] [Receptionist]: You too. Bye.\n[10:24] [Onre Wells]: Yes ma'am.

I was waiting for a beep. Usually there's a beep before someone gets put through. Uh, I just now saw your email. Let me go back to it. I swear, I I hate working on a laptop with these things.\n[03:48] [Camie Wade]: Oh, me too. Yeah, I get spoiled with my big screens.\n[03:51] [Landon Knots]: Paragraph 10, 11, 19, and 22.\n[03:57] [Camie Wade]: Yeah, so I've got a pretty hard-charging adjuster on this one. Um, she wants me to file the MSJ, she wants to get it done. Um, but I talked to her today and the apartment complex has med pay coverage of 5,000 that she said she would be willing to pay if we could get it done.\n[04:26] [Landon Knots]: Okay. Um, is there a, let's see. I'm meeting with with the the lit department manager this afternoon. This might be something that I bring up with him. I know we were able we were never able to uh get the actual residents involved in this one, which was a portion of it.\n[04:46] [Camie Wade]: Right. And I think they're I think they're ripe for a default. Um, they're just, you know, individuals that don't have insurance and are never going to they don't care if you get a judgment against them probably.\n[05:01] [Landon Knots]: Right. So let's see here. I'm just trying to get to the lease agreement. That was in disclosures? Or was that—\n[05:09] [Camie Wade]: Um, it would have been with our production. Yeah.\n[05:13] [Landon Knots]: Okay.\n[05:14] [ ... Silence (27s) ... ]\n[05:41] [Landon Knots]: Was it with that one? It would have been—\n[05:42] [Camie Wade]: Let me see when it was produced. Should have been around February 13th of last year. Is what it looks like we produced that.\n[05:55] [Landon Knots]: Okay.\n[05:56] [ ... Silence (21s) ... ]\n[06:17] [Landon Knots]: Here, paragraph— oh wow, that's really tiny print. Let's see here.\n[06:21] [Camie Wade]: Yeah, I had to blow it up pretty pretty big to read it.\n[06:24] [Landon Knots]: So the first one was paragraph 11? No, 10.\n[06:28] [Camie Wade]: Uh, 10, yeah.\n[06:30] [Landon Knots]: Okay.\n[06:31] [ ... Silence (24s) ... ]\n[06:55] [Landon Knots]: I don't see anything in number 10 that— are you looking specifically at things having to do with liability of the apartment complex? Like um, I know that's a broad question, but like for conduct of other residents?\n[07:05] [Camie Wade]: Yeah, well, and she she testified that she violated that lease. Like I went through it pretty closely with her in her deposition and she agreed that she breached the lease in 10 and 11, and then 19 and 22 deal with the apartment's liability.\n[07:22] [Landon Knots]: Okay.\n[07:23] [Camie Wade]: And if you want to take time and look at it and then respond, that's fine. I just wanted to let you know that I have the the five that I can offer if it'll get it to go away. If not, I'm going to have to do the motion.\n[07:38] [Landon Knots]: Okay. And what— I know that Todd was the one who was in the the deposition. I was able to review it some, enough to look for instances where she talked about like reporting prior instances with the dog or with the neighbors and all that stuff. What did she admit that she violated? Was it specific to this incident or or prior to?\n[08:04] [Camie Wade]: Yeah, the community standards by she's got a pending criminal assault charge against her for this accident or incident, whatever you want to call it.\n[08:13] [Landon Knots]: Right.\n[08:14] [Camie Wade]: She and her mom both are under criminal charges for it.\n[08:18] [Landon Knots]: Right. Okay. And then animals? Is that the one to number 12?\n[08:32] [Camie Wade]: I don't think there's anything specific to animals in there other than their disclaim liability for any actions by anybody on the property.\n[08:40] [Landon Knots]: Okay. Resident safety and loss. We do not warrant security of any kind. You agree that you will not rely upon any security measures taken by us for personal security. Okay. Not equipped or trained. I don't know if that would include a dog bite though. Let's see.\n[09:05] [Camie Wade]: Well, and I think it's going to have to be a comprehensive review of the lease and her testimony. And and you may call and talk to the lawyer that sat in on it. Um, I I've had clients before who were like that. Um, it was not a good deposition. I I don't think she's testified favorably um for any of the claims against the apartment. She said they didn't do anything wrong. And and again, I'm paraphrasing and you can look at it and see if you want to keep fighting about it, but I've got the five if that'll get it done.\n[09:40] [Landon Knots]: Right. I recall I recall seeing that um that question answered, I think, in the deposition where I think you asked something like um, \"Do you know what what the apartment complex did wrong to cause this to occur?\" or something like that. And she said no. I can't recall the exact way that was phrased. Let's see here.\n[10:04] [Landon Knots]: Okay. All right. I'll I'll see what we can do with the 5,000 and then just um go and get a default against the the individuals then. Um, okay. All right.\n[10:21] [Camie Wade]: Yeah, just let me know. Like I said, I've got a hard-charging adjuster. She wants it done one way or another, so I've just got to move it. Either just settlement or file the motion and go ahead.\n[10:32] [Landon Knots]: All right. Sounds good. Well, give me a chance to go back through the deposition testimony again and I'll try to highlight some things in there uh to see if we can try to wrap this up quicker.\n[10:43] [Camie Wade]: Okay. Thanks.\n[10:46] [Landon Knots]: All right. Thanks, Camie. Bye.\n[10:47] [Camie Wade]: Bye-bye.\n\n========================================\nTRANSCRIPT END\n========================================","data":{"caller_type":"law_office","call_summary":{"primary_intent":"speak_with_staff","resolution_achieved":true,"resolution_type":"transfer_attempted","resolution_basis":"transfer_path_entered","operational_terminal_state":"entered_transfer_path","secondary_action":null,"multi_case_details":false,"final_outcome":"The receptionist and an assistant transferred the caller to the requested attorney, who then discussed case details and a settlement offer.","call_duration_seconds":649.08,"call_duration_formatted":"10:49"},"transfer_context":{"destinations":["specific_staff_member"],"transfer_connection_status":[true],"reasons":["request_assigned_staff"],"description":"The caller was successfully transferred to Landon Knots after being screened by the receptionist and an assistant."}},"assistantId":null,"squadId":null,"audioUrl":"https://pub-f2d6ff6bf85041d8b86c7b26b9931dca.r2.dev/mccraw/20260127-145028_+18067937600_Incoming_Auto_3285997917016.mp3"},{"id":"2bx7qi5on8sxec65tngno9","path":"McCrawLaw-analysis/analysis/20260127-145154_+14694217361_Incoming_Auto_3286002076016_gemini.json","name":"20260127-145154_+14694217361_Incoming_Auto_3286002076016_gemini.json","callId":"20260127-145154_+14694217361_Incoming_Auto_3286002076016","resolution_type":"transfer_attempted","caller_type":"law_office","resolution_achieved":true,"transfer_success":true,"transfer_destination":"specific_staff_member","secondary_action":null,"call_duration":52.92,"primary_intent":"speak_with_staff","final_outcome":"The receptionist stated the intent to transfer the caller to the requested staff member and the call ended immediately afterward.","transcript":"========================================\nTRANSCRIPT START\n========================================\n\nSPEAKERS IDENTIFIED:\n  • Speaker 1 / Unknown / Role: Automated Voice: 1 turn\n  • Speaker 2 / Unknown / Role: Receptionist: 3 turns\n  • Speaker 3 / Alan / Role: Caller: 3 turns\n  • Speaker 4 / Salen / Role: Receptionist: 2 turns\n  • Speaker 5 / Camie Wade / Role: Caller: 2 turns\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n[00:00] [Automated Voice]: This call is being recorded.\n[00:04] [Receptionist]: Hello?\n[00:06] [Alan]: Hi, this is Alan, I'm calling with Smithy.

Hey, the reason I'm calling today is I wanted to find out, does your, uh, practice still do dog bites?\n[00:32] [Receptionist]: Um, yes, we do. Is this the first time you've contacted us about this?\n[00:37] [Adrian Castle]: Um, it is not, and I'm doing a follow-up call. I was a, uh, client of Mullen and Mullen, and they could not find that the owner had any, the liable party had any insurance. Um, so I had called your office to find out if you guys actually just allow the client to pay for the fees out of pocket for representation, and I was told that you don't. So I'm calling again today because I did find out, uh, through some search that the liable owner does have insurance on his house through another home that he owns.\n[01:13] [Receptionist]: I understand. Okay. Do you recall how long ago had you contacted us about this matter?\n[01:18] [Adrian Castle]: Uh, maybe seven to 10 days ago, maybe two weeks. As at that, and at that time, I believe that the owner did not have insurance. And that's when your, your office said, \"Oh, we wouldn't take a case if they don't have insurance.\"\n[01:32] [Receptionist]: Okay. All righty. I would like to, um, confirm some information with you and we can definitely look into this again for you and see what can be done.

Appreciate that info. And could you tell me a bit about the matter that he needs assistance with?\n[02:50] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, so we were at, um, Trane, uh, manufacturer heating and air conditioning. We were at a warehouse yesterday and, uh, he was in their warehouse and slipped and fell, uh, by the bay door. Uh, he hurt his side and he broke his wrist. He broke the bone and moved another bone over. He's got to have surgery Thursday. Uh, yeah. And, yeah, they had nothing down to prevent slip and fall. They had no, you know, no ice. And, yeah, some of these, uh, got on the sealed concrete floor, his feet just came out from under him. I seen the whole thing.\n[03:41] [Receptionist]: And he was in the warehouse? And this was in the warehouse when this happened?\n[03:45] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yes. Yeah, he was in the warehouse at Trane. We were backed up to the dock, we had backed up to two docks, one and three. He was at dock three. Uh, he had his truck backed up to that dock and we were, uh, kept calling for somebody to come over and help us with the forklift to lift the concrete pad. And the guys looked at me and ignored me and went the other way. I yelled at three or four times. So we picked it up, moved it from dock one to dock three to put it in that truck. Uh, and when he was getting back out of the truck and got back into the warehouse as he started to walk, his feet came out from under him and that's what happened.\n[04:29] [Receptionist]: Oh, I'm so sorry.\n[04:31] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, he fell pretty hard. Yeah, when he hit the fan that was by the bay door, it bent the housing on the fan. I seen that today because I was back in there picking up a unit there. And he hit that and he rolled. I was wondering how he got twisted up, but it rolled him over, flipped him over, and then to keep from hitting his head, why his wrist, his right hand, and it snapped the bone in two and pushed over both bones. Yeah, it was a mess.\n[05:02] [Receptionist]: Oh goodness. And may I ask how you heard about us? Was it referral or did you find us online or billboard?\n[05:11] [Glenn Mitroff]: Online, Google. Glenn Adams was my, uh, family lawyer. Yeah, and he deals with all my, my other cases when I need him. He's for the last 27 years, 28. Yeah, since '97. So...\n[05:34] [Receptionist]: Oh wow.\n[05:35] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, I was going to say I feel like '97 was just 10 years ago and it's not. I keep forgetting that.\n[05:42] [Receptionist]: Yeah, and anyway, so he's been our family attorney since then and one of them and, uh, he referred me to you guys years ago and I've used you all a few times for Alex.\n[05:58] [Glenn Mitroff]: And was he working at this warehouse or was he just picking up something?\n[06:04] [Receptionist]: No, we were picking stuff up. We were picking up equipment to take to customers.\n[06:10] [Glenn Mitroff]: Oh goodness. And they had no slip and fall protocol, no signs out, no nothing, right?\n[06:17] [Receptionist]: No, no slip, no no, no nothing, nada. They didn't even have anything out today, no ice melt, no nothing, when I went back today and walking up to the door, still solid ice. Yeah, the parking lot, the walkway. And...\n[06:33] [Glenn Mitroff]: And this was in, uh, Lavon?\n[06:35] [Receptionist]: No, this happened at the Mesquite branch, uh, the Dallas address. Yeah, but they call it the Mesquite location for Trane. Uh, yeah. And then after he's laying on the ground screaming and yelling, uh, and then he gets up and can't move his, his hand and it's letting it hang in pain and bent over. And then the guy that loaded the truck, this older guy, walks up, asks what happened. I told him, well, he fell. And that's when this is going to be a mess if he broke that thing, you know, for y'all's insurance and possibly mine, but I don't see where it'd go on my liability because I didn't, it wasn't my location, it was theirs.\n[07:23] [Receptionist]: It was theirs, yeah. May I ask the date of when he broke his wrist?\n[07:27] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yesterday. He called the, well, he called the warehouse manager, he told him what had happened. He gave me the guy's name and number and that's it. They didn't take any kind of report, but I took a few pictures. And that was it. Yeah, they offered no other assistance. He looked at him, he said, 'Oh, he'll be all right.' I'm like, 'No, I don't think so, dude. I'm pretty sure it's broke.' He couldn't drive. He got in the truck, he tried to, he's like, 'Dad, I can't drive. The pain's too bad.' I said, 'Well, get in my truck, I'll take you to the closest hospital.' So he did, he got in the back seat. I took him to the closest hospital, which was White Rock Hospital down on, uh, Garland Road and Buckner. Yeah, sure enough, it was broke, just what I thought.\n[08:21] [Receptionist]: Oh my goodness. What date did this happen on? I know he has surgery Thursday.\n[08:25] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yesterday. I can even tell you what time. I took pictures from when you look at the timestamp on the pictures. I'll tell you exactly what time it was. Uh, I took the pictures at 2:01. It happened probably less than five minutes before that. So, they've got cameras all over that place, inside and out. So, I would definitely request the cameras. They're not going to give them to me, but y'all could request them. And I'm sure they've got time and date on them too. The name and number that he gave me for the warehouse manager, I can give you that.\n[09:11] [Receptionist]: It looks like I'm not asking for it at this time yet. If you don't mind, I can see if I can try to grab somebody for you. Would that be okay?\n[09:23] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, because he's, he asked me earlier if anybody called back, because I talked to one yesterday and I said, 'No, I haven't heard anything.' So that's why I'm calling.\n[09:33] [Receptionist]: Okay, well let me, can I put you on a...\n[09:36] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah.\n[09:37] [Receptionist]: Can I put you on a brief hold and then I can try to grab somebody for you, sir?\n[09:43] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, thank you.\n[09:45] [Receptionist]: You're very welcome.\n[09:47] [ ...

Uh, I tripped— I tripped over a pallet that they had in the— in one of their aisles and messed up my right shoulder.\n[00:48] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let's see here. If you don't mind, I'm just going to go ahead and get some initial information from you. Uh, where was this Home Depot located?\n[00:58] [Randy Barger]: In Cedar Park, Texas.\n[01:01] [Receptionist]: Cedar Park, okay.\n[01:03] [Randy Barger]: June the 19th of last year, 25.\n[01:07] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me get your name put in. And then what's a good callback number for you just in case we get disconnected?\n[01:14] [Randy Barger]: 903-918-5680.\n[01:21] [Receptionist]: Awesome. And Randy, do you have a good email address?\n[01:24] [Randy Barger]: randybarger1@yahoo.com.\n[01:31] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Okay, let's see here. And Home Depot, okay. And you said in June of 25, correct?\n[01:51] [Randy Barger]: Yes ma'am, June the 19th.\n[01:53] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[01:54] [Randy Barger]: About— about 8:00 in the morning.\n[01:56] [Receptionist]: Okay. Can you kind of walk me through what exactly happened, kind of the process?\n[02:04] [Randy Barger]: Yeah. Uh, we were in there uh looking for some stuff down one of their aisles. It was kind of dark because it was real— really early in the morning, probably was more like 7:00, right shortly after they opened. Anyway, they had their pallets just stacked in the aisles like I'm sure you maybe you've seen, they have stuff sitting in the aisle there. Well, I had— I was going around one, I had a friend that she had already gone around it, and when I ran around it, there was a— happened to be one of those nylon straps that they strap things down with. It was sticking out from under the pallet and I didn't see it and it caught— my foot caught in it and I took a pretty hard tumble. And uh ended up hurting my shoul— my right shoulder. I've got a tear in my rotator cuff and the MRI showed two other tears as well, so—\n[03:01] [Receptionist]: So you have a total of three tears?\n[03:04] [Randy Barger]: Yes.\n[03:05] [Receptionist]: And it's all in the rotator cuff?\n[03:07] [Randy Barger]: Uh, well one of them's in my rotator cuff and the uh other two are down a little bit lower like in my shoulder area. It said something— it had something to do with my bicep. Uh, I fell pretty— pretty good ways and and pretty hard right on the concrete floor.\n[03:28] [Receptionist]: Okay. Goodness.\n[03:31] [Randy Barger]: Cut my hands all up, uh things like that. I wish we'd have taken pictures, but we forgot to do that.\n[03:41] [Receptionist]: Oh, so you don't have photos?\n[03:43] [Randy Barger]: No, I didn't. But Home Depot is admitting fault about it. We had a witness, actually one of their employees saw it all happen. So and she— I think it's documented with maybe a statement from her. I know her name is Cat or Kathy, but I think she goes by Cat. And uh I don't have a last name.\n[04:11] [Receptionist]: Okay, no worries. Okay, and as far as you um telling me that they are admitting— they're taking fault for this, um has their insurance company reached out to you? Have you um spoken with Home Depot about— can you kind of let me know um the status of that?\n[04:31] [Randy Barger]: Yes. Uh, they— the— a firm called Sedgwick, uh-huh, they handle all of their settlement claims. And that's who I've been talking with. And uh they're— they're— I think— I feel now they're giving me the runaround and uh I was told some things that weren't true. We were— I was trying to settle it like that just between me and them. And now they're telling me that there was never a settlement agreed on or anything like there's nothing documented whatsoever. And that's— that— I don't know if she did or she didn't, but but the discussions did happen.\n[05:17] [Receptionist]: Okay. And did they make you an offer already?\n[05:19] [Randy Barger]: We— yeah, we had tentatively— the figure 23,000 had come up. And uh we had verbally agreed. She was supposed to send me paperwork over— over the internet to DocuSign and uh she said, \"I'll have you a check out tomorrow.\" Well, that never happened. And then found out as of today, I don't know when it happened, but that lady that I was talking to, her name was Kristen, she's no longer with the company. So I don't know what happened, but now the people that that are handling it are trying to get— put in somebody else's hands to handle, they're telling me that those— that those conversations never happened, that they're not documented anywhere, and that's not true. I mean, they— I understand that they record those calls and uh they're definitely on there. I mean, we— her and I discussed it at length uh what hap— about it all and we kind of went back and forth on the amount and now they're denying it. Or and and then also, there's a— there's going to be a medical lien uh against it with the uh with uh Medicare. I have Humana Medicare and they've— they've got a lien on it to get their money back, which I don't— I don't have a lot of medical, but they— now what was being told me— told to me was the 23,000 was coming to me, full amount, and anything above that, the lien was— they was going to be separate. She— that's in the conversation. And now the lady is denying that and uh so I— I don't know where I stand now. Uh, I was expecting this to be over anytime, but now with what she's saying, all bets are off. You know, so I don't have an agree— I don't have an agreement apparently with them now.\n[07:23] [Receptionist]: Okay. And can you kind of walk me through what you did for— for treatment? Um, starting off with um, you know, did the ambulance come get you at Home Depot? Did you go get checked out on your own?\n[07:33] [Randy Barger]: No. Yeah, I went and got checked out on my own. I waited— I was out of town uh when it happened in Cedar Park and I I waited till I got home back here in Mount Pleasant to go see— I went to immediate care. They X-rayed it, of course they found it was inconclusive what they found, so I ended up having to go to a specialist, the orthopedics doctor, and had an MRI done. And of course the doctor's trying to say that that it can be taken care of with with therapy, but therapy is not working. You know, he said— he said as a last resort we'd we could address surgery. So I think it's coming down to surgery because I still have a problem with my right shoulder. Uh, it's not— it's not any better. I mean, it's better as far as movement, but I still have pain in my shoulder. Uh, you know, it's from— it's from this apparently from this rotator— anytime I start moving, I can't— I can't— it's hard for me to drive, putting my arm— any putting my arm up, you know, to prop it up on the steering wheel, it's hard. Uh, even— even hanging down the side— by my side, it hurts. So it's just constantly aches and and all, so uh you know, the mo— the movement had nothing to do with it. He tried to say it was froze up, but it's— that's not it. There's— obviously they found a tear, so there's a tear in there that needs to be addressed.\n[09:05] [Receptionist]: Right. And how long would you say you've been in physical therapy for?\n[09:09] [Randy Barger]: Well, I went through— I went through five rounds of physical therapy. I went back to see the doctor and he again told me, \"Well, you need to keep going to therapy. I want you to go through more therapy.\" But the thing is, I'm on a fixed income and the co-pay to go— to go to therapy every time, he wanted me to go through six more sessions and and it's $25 a time whenever I go for my co-pay. I— with my income, I can't afford that. I mean, because we're ended up it's, you know, between $100 and $200 there out of my income that I can't spare.\n[09:50] [Receptionist]: Right. Yes sir.\n[09:52] [Randy Barger]: And uh so I— I haven't been going this last little bit and I can start going back again if I need to. Uh, I need to go see the doctor again. I missed a— I missed an appointment because of the weather, so—\n[10:06] [Receptionist]: Okay. And so um you've been treating consistently since June or have you taken some time off in between? Um, when's the last time you think you went to therapy?\n[10:17] [Randy Barger]: I had— the doctor didn't— the doctor didn't put me through therapy until this past fall. He, you know, finally got to see— it took— it took forever to get— get uh to see a specialist because of my insurance getting approvals and all that, you know, referrals, getting that done. I don't know why it took so long, but it took a while to even get to see the doctor. So I started therapy right after I started seeing him, which was in the fall.\n[10:47] [Receptionist]: Okay. And when would you say the last time you went to therapy was?\n[10:52] [Randy Barger]: It was about a month ago.\n[10:54] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[10:57] [Randy Barger]: At Titus Regional.\n[11:01] [Receptionist]: Titus Regional, okay. Let's see here.\n\n[ ... Silence (11s) ... ]\n\n[11:15] [Randy Barger]: I mean, I just— I don't know what to do, you know, in with all this. I don't know what to do next because I was expecting this to be over with and they'd be sending me a check, but now that's apparently not what's going to happen.\n[11:29] [Receptionist]: Okay. And was it all your doctors that you've been seeing at Titus Regional as well?\n[11:35] [Randy Barger]: No, the doctor uh was uh was Dr. Jones and he is with Azalea Medical Group, which they— they have a— they see patients in Mount Pleasant as well, but I was having to go to Tyler for his main office is to see him.\n[11:51] [Receptionist]: Okay, yeah, I'm familiar with Azalea. Um, I've— I've had some— I had actually broken my arm not long ago and I went there as well um to see a doctor there in Tyler. Yeah. Okay. Um, and so let me ask you this, just a few more questions. Um, has Home Depot released any video footage or anything like that to you?\n[12:15] [Randy Barger]: No. I haven't— I haven't heard anything about— all they did was admit to fault.\n[12:21] [Receptionist]: Okay. And do you have any documents from them admitting to fault?\n[12:25] [Randy Barger]: No. It was all with— it was all with uh this from Sedgwick.\n[12:31] [Receptionist]: Sedgwick, okay. So all communication was through them?\n[12:34] [Randy Barger]: Yeah.\n[12:35] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[12:40] [Receptionist]: All right. Give me just a moment, I'm going to put you on a brief hold. I'm going to let one of our attorneys here um kind of review this um and see if it's something we can assist you with. Um, so give me just a moment to put you on a hold, okay?\n[12:53] [Randy Barger]: Okay.\n[12:54] [Receptionist]: Yeah, give me just a second. Thank you.\n[12:58] [Receptionist]: You still there, Randy?\n[13:01] [Randy Barger]: Yes ma'am.\n[13:02] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me ask you this because this is just going to be one of the things we're going to have to get around. Do you have any of the email threads or any communication with Sedgwick um whether that was through text message or email or was everything just the phone call?\n[13:20] [Randy Barger]: Everything was pretty much over the phone. Uh, let me see, I'll have to look. I might have got something in email, but uh if— that's been a while back. I don't know for— I can't remember for sure. You know, honestly, I didn't keep up with a lot of that because I thought it was being handled, you know, fine, you know, and I wasn't going to have to get to this point. So I thought— I just thought it, you know, was— was resolved by me just handling it, but uh apparently not. I mean, I don't know what their problem is now, so—\n[13:56] [Receptionist]: Right. Okay. Well, um will you go ahead and look through that, see if you can find any of those emails or um any of the documentation you have um for me and either give me a call back this evening or um I can reach out to you in the morning, check back up?\n[14:15] [Randy Barger]: Okay. Uh, why don't you call me if you don't mind? I tend to forget.\n[14:20] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[14:21] [Randy Barger]: So—\n[14:21] [Receptionist]: Okay, that's totally fine. What—\n[14:23] [Randy Barger]: I'm sorry, what law group is this? I've called so many now and I've lost my place on my phone, so I can't remember who I called.\n[14:30] [Receptionist]: No worries. This is McCraw again.\n[14:33] [Randy Barger]: Okay, that's what I've got here, I wasn't sure. So okay.\n[14:37] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Yeah, no worries. So what I'm going to do in the meantime, um we I'm just um something, you know, we we can't hop on too fast is we kind of want to see what um Sedgwick has mentioned to you uh as far as communication. If we can kind of get an idea of that, um we can, you know, that'll help us moving forward and seeing what we can do or where to take off from. I'm also going to speak with some of our other attorneys here um and let them know just in case, you know, you don't have that communication of what we could potentially do. But just to be safe, we want to know kind of what has been communicated if there's anything in documents that you might find.\n[15:17] [Randy Barger]: Okay. I'll look and see what I can find. I was bad about not keeping up with them, I'm just telling you up front. I I don't know if I can put my hands on— as far— the quickest thing maybe email if I've got something, so but I can check that real quick.\n[15:35] [Receptionist]: Okay. Well, look through your email. Um, if you can find anything, you know, screenshot it, um whatever you can do. I'll reach back out to you first thing in the morning and kind of follow up and see what you might have found. Um, and I might have an answer for you better of what we can do to help you out moving forward, okay?\n[15:51] [Randy Barger]: Okay.\n[15:52] [Receptionist]: Okay, awesome. I will speak with you in the morning, Randy.\n[15:57] [Randy Barger]: All right. Thank you so much.\n[15:59] [Receptionist]: Yeah, thank you.

So I gotta walk outside so she doesn't hear me because she's walking out. Thank you, you have a blessed one and we'll see you next time! Bye, thank you! So, um, I am married to someone who is incarcerated, um, and owns property in Mexico and also um is inheriting property from his parents. And um one of his sisters right now is their caregiver and has— takes care of them, but one of the brothers is reaching out to me because he's finding out that she's trying to change all the property that they have a will for that's left to them into her name. And I just found out she's trying to change some of his properties into her name, my husband's properties. I do have power of attorney over him, I established that while he was incarcerated. He has a life sentence so he's not getting out. Um, and I am wanting to see what I can do. I need to sell the properties or I need to make sure she's unable to sell the properties that are legally mine and his son's.\n[04:55] [Receptionist]: Okay, so um that's going to be not something that we can help with, but I do have a referral for someone who may be able to assist.

Um, we don't do any kind of real estate stuff specifically. Um, for— for that, uh I would say maybe try the state bar and see if they know anyone, but you may need someone uh who is specifically in Mexico for that.\n[05:51] [Melenda Moffett De La Rosa]: Okay. Yeah, because Mexico's tricky, I know there you have enough money you can pretty much change anything and do anything. So, um, okay, I'm gonna try Mark.

Mm-hm.\n[00:23] [Maria]: And it, uh, the homeowners, it happened at that house, but he's talking about that they have homeowners on another house.

I still don't think it would be wanted because if that was the case that that they could recover from that other property, then his other attorney would have done it. You know what I mean?\n[01:13] [Maria]: Yes. Yes, I'm trying to get him to—\n[01:15] [Miha]: So I just still don't— I still don't think it's wanted because of that situation. Um, and he had another attorney on it, I I don't know, we would have to get a withdrawal letter if it if it was wanted. We don't even have photographs of his bite to see if even just alone his bite alone is something that we would want. We don't even know if it's a serious bite or the injuries. Um, so to me, it's just still not wanted because his other attorney would would have took it— kept it if if it was possible to recover from that other property that he's saying.\n[01:55] [Maria]: Correct. Okay, let me try one more time.\n[01:58] [Miha]: But if he's not taking— but if he's not taking the rejection from you, if he's like adamant in not taking it, I would just tell him, um, let me, uh, let an attorney know what's going on and we'll give you a call back and then we can give him a another call back. And I would see if maybe if you tell Todd what's going on, like, hey, he thinks there's another property to recover from. I think it's still going to be a reject, but just so an attorney says so and then we can tell him per our attorneys.\n[02:26] [Maria]: Yes, I know. Okay.\n[02:27] [Miha]: Yeah.\n[02:29] [Maria]: Okay, I'll try it again. Appreciate you, Miha.\n[02:32] [Miha]: Oh, alright. Thank you.\n[02:34] [Maria]: Thank you.

And where's your apartment located? Which city, sir?\n[02:26] [James Taylor]: Plano, Texas.\n[02:29] [Receptionist]: Plano. Mhm. Okay. And then I know you said you're currently in the ER.

So I was able to have our attorneys review these details you provided me and he did want me to let you know that unfortunately this is not something that we could help you out with, sir, um, due to, um, the natural, um, conditions, uh, that caused your slip and fall.\n[03:37] [James Taylor]: Natural conditions? What do you mean by that?\n[03:41] [Receptionist]: Unfortunately, since, um, the ice, um, on the sidewalk was a natural condition, um, it's not something that we could assist you with. However, if you were still interested in seeking legal assistance for this matter, I could provide you the phone number to the Dallas Bar Association. They're a free referral service that way you could potentially get a second opinion, um, or they could just listen to your case, provide you a list of attorneys, um, that you could definitely reach out to see if they would be, um, able to assist you with this.\n[04:14] [James Taylor]: Okay. So are you saying that... uh, I mean... the the the complex is not liable for not... uh... uh... having the sidewalk cleared? That's what you're saying?\n[04:31] [Receptionist]: Mhm. Just in the state of Texas, premises liability cases like these are very difficult, um, for, you know, um, attorneys to, um, prove liability on these apartment complexes just because the state of Texas is very strict. Um, so with the the snow and ice being a natural-formed condition, mhm, unfortunately it would be difficult to prove the apartment liable for this incident.\n[05:01] [James Taylor]: So, ma'am, ma'am, are you saying that they're not liable to keep the grounds clear, especially after an ice storm? That's what you're saying? In the state of Texas?\n[05:13] [Receptionist]: Um, I am not saying that they are not liable. It is, um, just difficult to prove them liable for this incident. Um, so again, not saying that you don't have a case and we do highly encourage you to reach out, um, to, you know, other attorneys for the matter.\n\n========================================\nTRANSCRIPT END\n========================================","data":{"caller_type":"new_client","call_summary":{"primary_intent":"new_client_intake","resolution_achieved":true,"resolution_type":"information_provided","resolution_basis":"direct_service_completed","operational_terminal_state":"direct_resolution","secondary_action":null,"multi_case_details":false,"final_outcome":"The receptionist gathered intake details regarding a slip and fall incident, consulted with an attorney during a brief hold, and informed the caller that the firm would not be able to take the case.","call_duration_seconds":335.23,"call_duration_formatted":"05:35"},"transfer_context":{"destinations":[],"transfer_connection_status":[],"reasons":[],"description":"No transfer was attempted.

Um, I have a question for you. My name is Edith Jarnigan and I live in Harlingen, Texas. I have a grandson that goes to school and he takes the school bus. Well, he was taking the school bus. And one day, out of the blue, he came back and he didn't have his phone, his telephone with him. So what happened is in the way back from school, in the ride back, there was a three or four kids that they were bullying him. They took the phone, broke it, and never returned it back to him. And all this was for one hour. They were bullying him. And the bus driver never turned around, never helped, and even though when my grandson was trying to to get help, the driver ignored him. The situation here is is delicate because the bus driver didn't have doesn't have any training and on the top of it, the the person who's driving this bus doesn't speak English. So there's no way for this kid, this woman to help anybody, you know, even though he was asking for help.\n[01:43] [Receptionist]: Okay. I would like to collect some basic information. Our legal team would be able to review this and confirm how we can help. So I just need to collect a few more specifics. Um, can you provide me with the correct spelling for your last name, please?\n[01:57] [Edith Jarnigan]: Jarnigan. J-A-R-N-I-G-A-N. Jarnigan.\n[02:05] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for that.

The school said that I have to go to the school to the bus district. I'm not I'm not finding with or talking to a person that uh could offend me, you know, no, I I cannot go by myself.\n[03:54] [Receptionist]: No, I understand. I would like to confirm in regards to this situation, was your grandson physically harmed?\n[04:03] [Edith Jarnigan]: Not physical. It was emotional.

Um, what I'm saying is, um, yeah, he has issues uh trying to explain things.\n[04:49] [Receptionist]: Yeah, at this— this unfortunately wouldn't be something that we would be able to help with and unfortunately we handle just um personal injury cases for these type of issues directly with the school.

Would you like the number?\n[05:08] [Edith Jarnigan]: Sure. Sure. You're you're so kind.

I just was referred to, um, a my a one of my friends referred me to him.\n[00:24] [Receptionist]: Okay. And hold on one moment. What I can do is go ahead and take your information. Is this regarding a car accident or...\n[00:34] [Dawn Knowles]: It's regarding a car accident that my son had. Um, and I don't know if he will be able to help me, but I thought I'd ask him. Um, it was a— there's no injury involved. There— there were some questions I had about damage and stuff.\n[00:52] [Receptionist]: Okay. What's your name, ma'am?\n[00:54] [Dawn Knowles]: It's Dawn, D-A-W-N, Knowles, K-N-O-W-L-E-S.\n[00:59] [Receptionist]: And who's the one that referred you to Bryce, please?\n[01:03] [Dawn Knowles]: Um, Pamela Shelton.\n[01:06] [Receptionist]: Pamela Shelton. Is she an attorney?\n[01:11] [Dawn Knowles]: No, she's a realtor.\n[01:14] [Receptionist]: Realtor. Okay. Well, thank you for that.\n[01:17] [Dawn Knowles]: Sure.\n[01:18] [Receptionist]: And what's your phone number, Ms. Dawn?\n[01:20] [Dawn Knowles]: It's 805-603-9786.\n[01:26] [Receptionist]: 9786. What day— what's your son's name?\n[01:29] [Dawn Knowles]: Um, his name is Rock, R-O-C-K, Knowles, K-N-O-W-L-E-S.\n[01:33] [Receptionist]: Okay. And your address?\n[01:36] [Dawn Knowles]: Um, so I am actually in California. I'll give it to you, but um, my son lives in College Station. Um, but my address is, um, yeah. Is— what is the address? 30—\n[01:52] [Receptionist]: Well, I'll take his address.\n[01:53] [Dawn Knowles]: Oh, take his. Okay. He is, um, yeah, it's— I have to look it up because I don't know it.\n[01:58] [Receptionist]: Okay, no worries.\n[01:59] [ ... Silence (13s) ... ]\n[02:12] [Dawn Knowles]: Let's see here. So his— do you want his mailing address or— so he normally just— they use the mailing address, they don't use the physical over there, so I don't know if you just want an address for— yeah. Um, okay, sorry, I have to look this all up. Let's see, where is it? Okay, it is 3515 Longmire Drive, number 141, um, College Station, Texas, 77845.\n[02:38] [Receptionist]: 77845. What date was the accident and where did it happen?\n[02:43] [Dawn Knowles]: Um, it was on last Thursday, um, which I can't think of— I don't even know what today— 28th. So the 22nd of January. And um, it happened on the frontage road in College Station near the Nissan dealership. I guess that's the best I can tell you.\n[03:07] [Receptionist]: That's okay. Okay, I'm ready. And he was a driver, right?\n[03:13] [Dawn Knowles]: Yes, he was the driver. Um, they had— so do you want me to tell you about it or—\n[03:21] [Receptionist]: Please.\n[03:22] [Dawn Knowles]: Oh, okay. So, and he does better explaining it, but so imagine you're on the frontage road and I think there's two or three lanes. In the left lane, so that would be closest to the freeway, there was a— one of those transport car transport trucks that was um, he had I guess he had stopped or was almost stopped because he was going to have to do one of those wide turns into the Nissan dealership. My son was in the middle lane next to that and he was coming up towards that truck. And then there was a plumber's big pickup truck behind the transport truck. And I guess the plumber's pickup truck obviously realized that that truck was stopped or almost stopping and so he jumped into the lane in front of my son. My son slammed his brakes on, they locked, and he hit him. So my son, even though he was behind. So that happened. Um, there's no damage to the plumber's truck, of course, because of the big truck. They're probably going to total my son's truck just because it seems like nowadays that's what they do. They haven't decided yet. Um, but we— they called the police. Um, the police officer came out, he interviewed my son, he interviewed the plumber truck guy. He never interviewed the transport guy that was in the way of all this, which is what my issue was. And then he immediately told my son, \"Okay, you're at fault.\" And that was it. And so then they of course exchanged insurance. My son has USAA, we have all have USAA. And so USAA right now is trying to figure out if they're going to just total the car or what they're doing. Pretty sure they're going to total it, um, just because it's a— also a— a Hilux, it's a different kind of car. Um, but I just wanted to see— I wanted to talk to Bryce mainly to see— I— I was upset because I don't understand why the police officer never interviewed the transport truck guy who was the one that was in a lane— on the very left lane that was going to go over another lane to get, you know, make that right. And so I just wanted to, you know, kind of check on that. And like I said, it may be that he can't help us, but at least I wanted to ask the questions.\n[05:44] [Receptionist]: Okay. And so there was just two cars involved. No one ever hit the car transport, right, truck?\n[05:51] [Dawn Knowles]: Nobody hit the car transport, no.\n[05:53] [Receptionist]: Okay. And so he was not injured and he got the ticket. What— what was the ticket for?\n[05:59] [Dawn Knowles]: So he got a ticket for going 45 in a 40 because he told the police officer he was going 45, which is what he said he was, you know, he was being honest. Exactly. Yeah, so on top of— yeah, so on top of everything, the police officer said, \"Okay, well, you're at fault and by the way, I'm giving you this ticket for going 45 in a 40.\" Um, so that's what the ticket was. Oh my god. I know. I was so mad. I was like, \"Really? Insult to injury.\" Yeah. So anyways, so he got the ticket, which of course I think is due in like a week and we'll pay that. Um, but I— like I said, I think the big— and then the plumbing truck guy, like I— I don't know, you know, what happened with that. Um, I mean, like if I asked Rocky and he said, \"Yeah, there wasn't really damage to his truck because it's one of those big heavy work trucks.\" Right. But he— I asked him, I said, \"Did you ask the police officer to talk to the transport guy?\" Because he— you know, he should— he was at least a witness and honestly, in my fault— I mean, my opinion, he's the real reason it happened. But Rocky said no, he didn't talk to him at all. And also my Rocky's 26, he's young and he's a student, so I wondered if the police officer was, \"You're young and...\" I don't know.\n[07:18] [Receptionist]: And so— he got the ticket. Okay. So let me see if I— if Bryce is in and I can tell him what's going on, okay, Ms. Dawn?\n[07:28] [Dawn Knowles]: Okay, thank you.\n[07:29] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. So give me a minute, okay?\n[07:31] [Dawn Knowles]: Okay, thanks.\n[07:32] [ ... Silence (29s) ... ]\n[08:01] [Receptionist]: Okay, I'm sorry, he's not available, Ms. Dawn. What I can do is send him a message and with your phone number 805-603-9786 for him to call you.\n[08:14] [Dawn Knowles]: Okay, that would be great. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.\n[08:18] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. And I don't know— I'm not going to lie to you and tell you he's going to call you today because I'm not sure. I don't want to lie and say, \"Oh yeah, he's going to call you.\"\n[08:25] [Dawn Knowles]: No, no, no. You never know how busy— I'm a realtor too, that's how I know Pamela and yeah, I get it, like we're all running around. But yeah, I wanted to at least get the call started. So, okay, thank you so much.\n[08:37] [Receptionist]: Okay, sure. Thank you, Ms. Dawn. Bye.\n[08:40] [Dawn Knowles]: Thanks, bye.\n\n========================================\nTRANSCRIPT END\n========================================","data":{"caller_type":"new_client","call_summary":{"primary_intent":"new_client_intake","resolution_achieved":true,"resolution_type":"transfer_attempted","resolution_basis":"fallback_accepted","operational_terminal_state":"transfer_failed_fallback_accepted","secondary_action":"message_taken","multi_case_details":false,"final_outcome":"The receptionist collected intake details regarding a motor vehicle accident and attempted to locate a specific staff member.

On multiple occasions, I got injured while moving furniture, loading it and unloading it into vans and trucks, moving it to different locations. I, uh, reached out to my employer on several occasions and requested, well, initially I informed, I wasn't really familiar with how it goes, so I informed her of my initial injury and, uh, she basically told me to go to the doctor to get checked out, but using my own insurance. Uh, once I went to the doctor and found out that my insurance did not cover that, uh, type of, uh, visit, I informed her that, you know, my insurance doesn't cover, can you refer me to a doctor or a clinic to get checked out? She said she would check into it, didn't get back to me. I have several, I have all of the text messages of our communication since the day I started working with the company. All the work orders, especially the ones that they sent me, you know, requiring two people. I got text messages from texting her back and saying, \"Hey, I'm not going to be able to lift this or load this, it's too heavy,\" you know, and or I can, you know, and she would send me the work order the following week to do it again. Uh, I have work orders where, I mean not work orders, text messages where I've indicated that I've injured myself or hurt myself or re-injured or I'm in severe pain, you know, due to all the lifting that I'm doing and, you know, she would say stuff like, \"Wow, you need to get some rest,\" but turn around and send me five work orders to move more stuff. I'm talking about immediately after, or like get rest or go buy a back brace, but she never would submit in a request, uh, for a claim or anything like that. And like I said, I have all the text messages and, and, you know, from the day I started. And, uh, I went through the process with her insurance company, but they denied me today.\n[04:46] [Receptionist]: Okay, so the insurance, okay. Let me, and you said the denial, you received the denial today?\n[04:54] [George Groves]: Well, they called me and told, told me about the denial. He said he'll send me an email shortly.\n[05:01] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me place you on a brief hold, give me just a second.\n[05:05] [George Groves]: Okay.\n[05:06] [ ...

They had to open my doors, but just because the car has been totaled, which we're waiting on them for the total loss. But there was an ambulance. My chest was hurting.\n[04:20] SPEAKER 2: So the ambulance checked the EMT checked me out in the ambulance. Okay. And my vitals were good. My blood pressure was skyrocketed. They wanted to take me to the hospital, but I felt like I was okay, so I declined.\n[04:41] SPEAKER 2: Then through the next few days, I started to have, you know, just the general pain, but I I hurt my knee. I'm not sure how. I guess maybe moving my foot so quickly to the brake. I Oh, okay. Did something to my knee, and and then my chest was hurting.\n[05:10] SPEAKER 2: So I went back to the ER. I got the information from the insurance company so that they would pay for the hospital visit. Okay. So I got that covered with them. I gave them the claim number, the hospital, the claim number, everything.\n[05:29] SPEAKER 2: I went to the ER.\n[05:32] SPEAKER 1: Let's see. Which ER did you go to?\n[05:37] SPEAKER 2: Texas Health.\n[05:39] SPEAKER 1: Texas Health. Miss Selena?\n[05:43] SPEAKER 2: It's in Frisco.\n[05:45] SPEAKER 1: Frisco. Okay. So\n[05:49] SPEAKER 2: I did that on the twenty seventh. Yeah. So they did X-ray.\n\n   [ ... Hold / Silence (6s) ... ]\n\n[06:01] SPEAKER 1: Okay. Nothing broken?\n[06:04] SPEAKER 2: No. Yeah. They did X rays of my knee and my ankle. Nothing was broken, but that's all they could see in the X-ray. Right.\n[06:14] SPEAKER 2: Then they did a chest CT scan with the contrast dye. Okay. And that all looked okay. So she thought see, I was having trouble swallowing. Not in my throat, but down lower in my chest, my esophagus.\n[06:41] SPEAKER 2: Oh my goodness. So the doctor has prescribed me some medication, which I'm just starting today. Since the ice storm, I wasn't able to get to this.\n[06:53] SPEAKER 1: Right. Right. Okay.\n[06:55] SPEAKER 2: Go pick it up. But she thought that there was probably I've had some swelling, which had caused the esophagus to have some issues. But in this CT scan, it was all looking okay.\n[07:14] SPEAKER 1: Okay.\n[07:15] SPEAKER 2: And then my knee, nothing is broken. So they the insurance, you know, when they gave me the information to pay to the hospital to have them pay for the bill. Mhmm. She said she was gonna call me on Thursday to check on me and offer me a settlement. I didn't really know what that meant, but from what my friend had said, you need to talk to somebody.\n[07:47] SPEAKER 2: My main issue, I think, is my knee because I know that can be an ongoing issue.\n[07:56] SPEAKER 1: Correct.\n[07:56] SPEAKER 2: The doctor said it yeah. The doctor said it would take, like, four to six weeks to notice a big change getting better or not. So I don't know. Is this the fact I don't know what's gonna happen in the future and what I'm gonna need. So I don't know what I'm supposed to do about this settlement.\n[08:20] SPEAKER 2: Is\n[08:20] SPEAKER 1: your knee swollen?\n[08:24] SPEAKER 2: It is a little bit. Okay. Not a lot. It's mainly just really sore.\n[08:32] SPEAKER 1: Sore. Okay. And whenever they went take took you out, did they use the Jaws of Life, or they had to really yank the door?\n[08:41] SPEAKER 2: No. They just had to really yank the door because Okay. The frame, you had gone into compacted into the Wow. Doors. Sorry about that.\n[08:53] SPEAKER 2: The airbags did not go off.\n[08:55] SPEAKER 1: They didn't? Oh my goodness. Which,\n[09:02] SPEAKER 2: I guess, maybe it was a blessing to, like, disguise because I wasn't injured than from any airbag. Mhmm. And the seat belt held me in.\n[09:16] SPEAKER 1: Maybe that's why your chest is hurting. No. I don't know. I'm just saying.\n[09:19] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Yeah. That is. Yeah. It was so hard.\n[09:24] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. That's yeah. Because I did have some bruising where the seat belt was.\n[09:29] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. Oh my goodness. And how about eating and sleeping? Are you doing okay with that?\n[09:38] SPEAKER 2: Well, my knee hurts so bad that, you know, it wakes me up in the night. So I've been taking some the doctor told me not to take ibuprofen, to take some extra strength Tylenol. So that's been helping a little bit.\n[09:58] SPEAKER 1: Good. Good. And that's all you're taking for the pain? Yes. K.\n[10:07] SPEAKER 1: And are you do you have a doctor's appointment or anything like that to check your knee out or anything as of now?\n[10:18] SPEAKER 2: No. They didn't see anything in the X-ray. Okay. Doctor didn't think that I would have torn a meniscus or anything just from moving my leg that fast. I think I just jacked it up.\n[10:32] SPEAKER 2: You know? Not really sure, but but, like, it nothing showed in the X-ray.\n[10:39] SPEAKER 1: Good. Good. I'm happy to hear that. How are you eating? So you're still having problems with swallowing, I mean, down in the chest.\n[10:48] SPEAKER 1: Correct?\n[10:48] SPEAKER 2: It's I guess because some swelling irritated the esophagus. So I just picked up the medication that I can start taking that's gonna help that.\n[11:03] SPEAKER 1: So were you stranded too for a few days because of the ice storm?\n[11:10] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. That's why I would've gone to the ER sooner, but I didn't wanna have an accident trying to get there. So I didn't get to I didn't get back to the emergency room till Tuesday.\n[11:24] SPEAKER 1: Tuesday. Okay. Appreciate that. Well, I'm glad you didn't because it was bad out there. Y'all got it\n[11:28] SPEAKER 2: worse than we did. I'm in Amarillo. Yeah.\n[11:31] SPEAKER 1: It is. Yeah.

I know.\n[11:58] SPEAKER 2: Wow.\n[12:00] SPEAKER 1: Just have to be careful. So okay. Has the insurance company called you State Farm? Have they made you an offer?\n[12:10] SPEAKER 2: It's Farmers. Farmers. So they're supposed to call me today to make a a settlement offer. K. But I wasn't sure what to do.\n[12:22] SPEAKER 1: Yes. Okay. So I can get an attorney on the phone, and he he can explain everything to you. And whatever you do, don't take the offer. Okay?\n[12:34] SPEAKER 2: Okay.\n[12:35] SPEAKER 1: Until you speak to this attorney. I'm gonna get him on the phone\n[12:38] SPEAKER 2: with you.\n[12:39] SPEAKER 1: And do you have insurance on your vehicle by any chance?\n[12:45] SPEAKER 2: Yes. But we didn't have to claim because my insurance agent has been helping me, but she said, right now, if I were to make a claim on my insurance\n[12:59] SPEAKER 1: Mhmm.\n[12:59] SPEAKER 2: It would still the rates would still go up because they're looking at 3.3. Okay. It's all good. Yeah. So there the Farmers Insurance is covering everything.\n[13:11] SPEAKER 2: I'm waiting to hear back about the car total loss, but the bodily injury person called me on Tuesday, so I got the information so that I could go to the ER.

Uh, I know she wanted a copy of the insurance, Medicare and Blue Cross and my, uh, I think she asked for my driver's license, I'm not gonna swear on that right now, I'm not looking at the email. And I know she wanted a contact, last one I had was for, uh, Laurel Jones and I don't know if she can get a hold of them or not, but I want to give her all that information, but I'm not gonna send all my, uh, cards and stuff going back and forth.\n[01:30] [Receptionist]: So y'all been having, um, you've been having issues with, um, your emails?\n[01:38] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Uh, yeah, I got it back up finally yesterday and, uh, Saturday we're gonna switch carriers, so I don't know what's gonna happen after that.

I don't know if she has an extension or whatever.\n[02:22] [Receptionist]: You said you do have her, um, direct email though, right? To when you've, um, been getting in communication with her?\n[02:32] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Well, when she sends it, I try to, uh, answer about then, but I got one M Thomas at McCraw Law Group dot com, I think, yeah.\n[02:45] [Receptionist]: Yes, yes.\n[02:48] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: But, uh, I know I have her in there as a contact, so I don't know how that would go with that phone number.

It's definitely unique.\n[05:12] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: I know everybody says, \"That's pretty.\" I said, \"Not if you got teased by it when you were a child.\" Even though it starts with a V, they always pronounce it with a B.\n[05:25] [Receptionist]: Let's see. Okay, I got all of this down. Um, is there anything else that you would like me to let her know?\n[05:35] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Uh, I don't know, I know she wanted to contact that I had and I'm not sure if she's still there or not because, uh, I had a conference call set up with her two or three times and twice she failed to answer me and then I got a text that went to somebody named Boyd. I don't know who it was 'cause I kept looking for it and it disappeared and I even went to the trash and I couldn't find it.\n[06:06] [Receptionist]: So you're also having issues with, um, your number with Mary being able to contact the right number?\n[06:14] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: With my phone number?\n[06:16] [Receptionist]: Mhm.\n[06:17] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: No, I'm not having any problems right now. Not that she calls. Uh, I make no bets on anything else. Because I think that email's working right now.\n[06:30] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[06:31] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Because I'm seeing a lot of stuff coming through, so.\n[06:36] [Receptionist]: Okay.\n[06:37] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: All right, and if she calls me, I can give her some of the information she wants. Uh, I don't particularly want my insurance and driver's license going through a line that's going to everybody, which I don't know how well protected it is, you know, you understand what I'm saying?\n[06:58] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. I, I see, I understand.\n[07:04] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Okay.\n[07:05] [Receptionist]: Okay, great. I have all of this down for her. I'm going to make sure that I forward this message to her. I'm going to also leave your number on this message and then she should be reaching out to you as soon as she's, um, available. I saw that she, um, left a voicemail for you yesterday.\n[07:23] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, I got that late yesterday afternoon.\n[07:25] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. So I am going to make sure that she sees this and knows that you called back, leave behind the information and, um, she should be reaching out to you when she's available.\n[07:37] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, like I said, Saturday we get new carrier and I don't know, I hopefully there's no problem switching over, but you never know.\n[07:48] [Receptionist]: Yeah. I, Mary should be able to answer all of those, um, questions too when she, um, is available. She'll be able to answer that, that type of stuff.\n[08:00] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Okay. Uh, does she stay in the office in Wylie all the time or she, I know y'all got one in McKinney, I don't know how she plays around, you know what I mean? She might be, she might be in McKinney, if she's smart she would be.\n[08:16] [Receptionist]: I'm actually, I'm not quite sure. I, um, could ask her and check in to see if she's been, um, to the Wylie location frequently, but...\n[08:31] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Yeah, uh, I sent a, a message from her text that said call me, but, uh, you know, where I did that right, I don't know. I'm half, half asleep and half awake, so.\n[08:45] [Receptionist]: Understandable, it's been a long week.\n[08:48] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Oh, it has, like, it's been a month almost, seems like. Then we're gonna get hit with another one coming in, I think Saturday too. Hopefully if there's no rain or anything, we'll be okay.\n[09:04] [Receptionist]: You know, I'm glad to definitely see the weather's turning up. All right, I have all of your information. Is there anything else that you would like me to...\n[09:14] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: No, I just need know what she wants, uh, you know, I've got Laurel Jones, that's the only contact that I have, the last one that I had. And like I said, they sent me something with a Boy— Boyd, I think it was B-O-Y-D, I'm not sure. I don't even know what the first name was 'cause it just, you know, I was trying to look at it real fast and, like I said, when I went back, it disappeared and it wasn't in trash either, so I don't know what happened with that person.\n[09:47] [Receptionist]: Hmm, that's unusual.\n[09:52] [Receptionist]: Okay, I have all this down. Um, okay, so that, this should be good. I'll make sure that this message gets forwarded over to her and that should be, yeah, that should be all. I hope you have an amazing day and thanks for calling.\n[10:11] [Vrdie Marie Turner]: Me too.\n[10:12] [Receptionist]: And you too.
