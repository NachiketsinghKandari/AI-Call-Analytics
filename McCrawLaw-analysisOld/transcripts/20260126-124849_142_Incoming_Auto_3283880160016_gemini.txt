----------------------------------------

[00:00] SPEAKER 1: This call is being recorded. Hey. What's up?
[00:05] SPEAKER 2: Hey. Okay. So on this I'm looking at Delfino.
[00:10] SPEAKER 1: So Give just a moment. Let me if I pull it up. It was just at lunch.
[00:15] SPEAKER 2: Okay. Oh,
[00:21] SPEAKER 1: yes. It's almost the exact same report, if I'm remembering correctly, just with
[00:25] SPEAKER 2: Where is there another report with the semi truck driver somewhere? That's I think that's what we were waiting on. Right?
[00:33] SPEAKER 1: That's what he doesn't know because the semi is it was a hit and run. He doesn't know if anything was ever found on them.
[00:44] SPEAKER 2: Okay. Well, the deceased is Unit 1. We'll just be able to look up that guy's name and see if there's another police report attached to it. You know what I mean?
[00:57] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. He's told me that he told me that the DPS officer told him he would not be able to retrieve anybody else's report except for his own.
[01:06] SPEAKER 2: Oh, maybe there's a for maybe there's a criminal investigation going on. Probably.
[01:10] SPEAKER 1: So he got in contact with Luis this for the second report, the friend that he made, and Luis retrieved his own report and gave it to him. Okay.
[01:22] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Well, we have access to Chris again. So I what I would do is this. I would go search Louis the the deceased name, who is Tuan Coroz, and see
[01:36] SPEAKER 1: Do you have access or only Linda? Do you know? Do need a general account?
[01:41] SPEAKER 2: She'll probably have the login if you just wanna ask her for it. And I will just go see what that's if there's a because he would technically probably be on the deceased. We're probably on, like, three police reports. You know? One for Mhmm.
[01:54] SPEAKER 2: The semi, one for Luis, and one for Delfino. I would assume they're saying it's three separate events. And then but the thing is if there's an active criminal investigation going on right now against the semi, then they might not have released the semi police report.
[02:15] SPEAKER 1: You know
[02:15] SPEAKER 2: what I mean?
[02:16] SPEAKER 1: Okay. Yeah. He doesn't know anything else going on with the semi, but I do see on the withdrawal letter that his previous attorney isn't retaining an interest.
[02:30] SPEAKER 2: Yeah. The issue is He's nice guy. My my issue is I'm pretty sure and why I wanna be careful about this one. I'm pretty sure that Delfino is probably the one that actually, you know, might kill this guy. And Yeah.
[02:45] SPEAKER 2: That's a really, really bad fact for us. So I just wanna be careful and have all the information before I make a decision. And I'm not saying it was his fault. You know what I mean?
[02:56] SPEAKER 1: Mhmm.
[02:56] SPEAKER 2: But I I wanna see what we're dealing with and what the other reports say. Because they if they're on the tool way, they they probably pulled footage with a death. So that's where I'm at right now.
[03:09] SPEAKER 1: K. Let me look. And then October 21. I don't trying to look on Chris as if I was, like, the name of the deceased, as if I was purchasing my own police report.
[03:36] SPEAKER 2: Right.
[03:36] SPEAKER 1: But it says nothing nothing is available. Like, not I don't even see the other two.
[03:42] SPEAKER 2: Oh, weird. Alberto. How that how that not pop up? I mean, that's weird. 10/2125.
[03:55] SPEAKER 2: Juan Carlos. Carlos. And it's weird they're all separated.
[04:05] SPEAKER 1: It's like a. Mhmm.
[04:07] SPEAKER 2: Should be one event.
[04:08] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. I don't even see I don't even see the other two. That's so weird. Under the looking at the deceased name.
[04:25] SPEAKER 2: Right. I don't know, Kim. I don't know. This one scares me. Let's let's just table it till intake level 10, and then we'll go from Okay.
[04:41] SPEAKER 1: Alright. Gloria might join us in Elton tomorrow,
[04:44] SPEAKER 2: she said. She cannot. Because
[04:47] SPEAKER 1: she told me why there's there's a 115 leads, and only five were wanted last week. Isn't that crazy?
[05:00] SPEAKER 2: Well, that's what that's what they told us. That it would be like. So alrighty. Yeah. We'll figure it out.
[05:08] SPEAKER 2: Do
[05:10] SPEAKER 1: you hear us anybody if we're
[05:11] SPEAKER 2: gonna be in in the office tomorrow? Do have any idea? I haven't yet. Nearby? Okay.
[05:16] SPEAKER 2: Sounds good.
[05:17] SPEAKER 1: But if you hear if you talk to anyone and they happen even any attorney, and they happen to go into the office later or they happen to be there, let me know. I need someone to take a look at our handheld office phones up front because I don't know if the girls mess with the settings, but our calls are, like, delaying.
[05:38] SPEAKER 2: Oh, like, they're not going directly to y'all? Yeah. Uh-oh. Okay.
[05:43] SPEAKER 1: So if you happen to hear of anybody being there, let me know.
[05:46] SPEAKER 2: Okay. I would and for that re I would just send something in the general chat, like, the McRoll chat and say, hey. Is anybody in the office that can help assist me with something? I would probably ask. You know what I mean?
[05:59] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. I just don't want them to be like, what's going on? And then freak out about
[06:03] SPEAKER 2: Oh, no. I hear you. I know. I know.
[06:05] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. Because we are getting them. They're just delayed, or we're having, like, to call people right back.
[06:13] SPEAKER 2: Weird. Okay. Yeah. Just I'll I'll let you know if I hear about anybody that that's in there, but I don't think anybody is there.
[06:20] SPEAKER 1: Yeah. I don't think so either. Like, if anybody Suzanne would be there, and I thought Emily and they're not there. So I'm like, yeah. Probably nobody.
