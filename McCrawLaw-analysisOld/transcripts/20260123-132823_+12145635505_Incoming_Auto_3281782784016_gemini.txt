----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded.
[00:03] [Receptionist]: McCall Law Group, this is Terika, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Ryan Fields]: Hi, uh, my name is Ryan Fields. I was wondering if I could either speak with Ariana or Drake, whoever's available. They're, they're working my case.
[00:16] [Receptionist]: Uh, she— give me one moment, please.
[00:18] [Ryan Fields]: No problem.
[00:20] [Receptionist]: Okay, so the case manager for your case is currently unavailable. May I take a message and forward it for you?
[00:28] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, I just, I— I really, they can just send me an email if they want to, they don't even have to give me a call back. I just, I had submitted my release for, uh, like, like my case was getting settled and everything, so I had sent over a release and, like, wiring docs and everything about two and a half weeks ago, and then I've just never heard anything else about it. Um, I spoke with Drake last Friday and he said he hadn't heard anything from them, but that he'd check on it and he was supposed to either call me back like end of the day Friday, um, or call me back on, on Monday, and then I've called a couple times and I've just never heard anything back. So I was just looking for some kind of update.
[01:05] [Receptionist]: Do you want me to see— I can, um, check if Drake is available?
[01:09] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, yeah, if you can check if Drake's available, that'd be fine. I, yeah.
[01:12] [Receptionist]: Give me one moment, please.
[01:14] [Ryan Fields]: Cool, thank you.
[01:17] [Drake]: Hey Ryan, this is Drake, how you doing?
[01:20] [Ryan Fields]: Hey Drake, I'm doing well, how you doing, man?
[01:22] [Drake]: Good, good, just getting ready for this weather. But hey, I know you're probably calling about the, the check. I have not got it yet. So I have—
[01:29] [Ryan Fields]: Okay, yeah, I was, yeah, Drake, you're good. I was just calling for an update. I just had to make sure that I was doing my due diligence on my side.
[01:34] [Drake]: No, I hear you a million percent. And usually we get it by this point, so let me follow up with them again and see what—
[01:41] [Ryan Fields]: So, and that was one— and so that was one thing that I had, so I had forgot to mention this last time we talked. So, I know y'all didn't— y'all weren't really involved in, like, the property side of getting everything done, but they put me through a very similar rigmarole when it came down to actually paying the body shop.
[01:57] [Drake]: Okay.
[01:58] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, so the car— so my car, like, 'cause you know they put me through that whole rigmarole of taking six months to even take the car to go get fixed, right? Or it was like four or five months. So the car ended up being done at the end of May, and then they gave me, like, a whole big headache back and forth on if they were even going to send me a check or when they were going to send it and the whole thing. So they finally send it, they send it to me, it gets to me by the middle of June, and then they had cut it from, uh, what was called the Royal Bank of Canada.
[02:31] [Drake]: Oh wow.
[02:32] [Ryan Fields]: So when I took it to go deposit it, they told me that it was going to take a minimum of 35 days to be able to clear my account because it was an international check. And then, um, so then, you know, the body shop wasn't really trying to accept that as an answer, so then I had to go do a whole another, like, two weeks of back and forth with them to finally get them to just do an electronic wire transfer to me. And that ended up finally coming. So like I said, my car ended up being done end of May, but because of the whole shenanigans they put me through on funds, I couldn't pick it up until July 3rd. Like, literally, like, the day— like the day that Haley found out that she had to get— ended up having to get surgery.
[03:08] [Drake]: Oh wow.
[03:09] [Ryan Fields]: So that was just one thing I wanted to put, like, kind of, you know, in the background so that way y'all know that that might be something they're trying to do again or trying to whatever. So I don't know if y'all have a way to, like, step the wires, but y'all might have one.
[03:19] [Drake]: Yeah, I'm going to be proactive on it and kind of send, not a threatening email, but a strongly worded email to try and get this.
[03:26] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah.
[03:27] [Drake]: Yeah, and I would imagine, you know, I mean, they're probably not, you know, itching to cut a $60,000 check.
[03:34] [Ryan Fields]: Yeah, yeah, no, I hear you, I hear you. So, okay.
[03:37] [Drake]: Yeah, I got you. I appreciate you following up. I'm going to go ahead and, uh, reach out to them again and see what the delay is and let them know, hey, we've had this issue in the past, let's not delay this any further, let's just make sure it all gets done properly and efficiently.
[03:51] [Ryan Fields]: Perfect, perfect. Well, I appreciate you, man. Um, is there anything that you're needing from me or anything, or anything you need from Haley at the moment?
[03:57] [Drake]: Not right now. Everything's going smoothly. Um, we're just still working on, uh, getting everything going with her, and then once I have a good update for you for either of y'all, I'll give you a call, okay?
[04:08] [Ryan Fields]: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
[04:10] [Drake]: Thanks Ryan. Bye now.
[04:11] [Ryan Fields]: Thanks. Bye-bye.
