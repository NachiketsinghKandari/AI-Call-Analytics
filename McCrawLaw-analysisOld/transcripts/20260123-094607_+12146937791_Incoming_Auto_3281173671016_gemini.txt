[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded.
[00:03] [Receptionist]: The Kellogg Group, this is Tarekka, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Marie Turner]: Uh, I don't know how you got dialed, I was talking to my husband and I'm— this is Marie Turner, Birdie Marie Turner, and I don't know why it dialed because like I said I was just talking to my husband and he hung up. Sat in my lap. Oh.
[00:25] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay, I gotcha.
[00:27] [Marie Turner]: I was just checking to see if you're working today, see.
[00:30] [Receptionist]: Yes, yes we are.
[00:33] [Marie Turner]: I'm sorry to bother you, but like I said I don't even know how that happened because it sat in my lap.
[00:39] [Receptionist]: That's okay. No bother at all.
[00:41] [Marie Turner]: I guess that means I need a new phone, doesn't it? All right, y'all have a good day.

[00:56] [Receptionist]: All right. Well, hope that goes well. Have a nice day.
[00:59] [Marie Turner]: All right. Talk to you later. All right. Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.
