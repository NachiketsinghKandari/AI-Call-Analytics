[00:34] [Dawn Knowles]: It's regarding a car accident that my son had. Um, and I don't know if he will be able to help me, but I thought I'd ask him. Um, it was a— there's no injury involved. There— there were some questions I had about damage and stuff.
[00:52] [Receptionist]: Okay. What's your name, ma'am?

[01:18] [Receptionist]: And what's your phone number, Ms. Dawn?

[01:29] [Dawn Knowles]: Um, his name is Rock, R-O-C-K, Knowles, K-N-O-W-L-E-S.
[01:33] [Receptionist]: Okay. And your address?
[01:36] [Dawn Knowles]: Um, so I am actually in California. I'll give it to you, but um, my son lives in College Station. Um, but my address is, um, yeah. Is— what is the address? 30—
[01:52] [Receptionist]: Well, I'll take his address.
[01:53] [Dawn Knowles]: Oh, take his. Okay. He is, um, yeah, it's— I have to look it up because I don't know it.
[01:58] [Receptionist]: Okay, no worries.
[01:59] [ ... Silence (13s) ... ]
[02:12] [Dawn Knowles]: Let's see here. So his— do you want his mailing address or— so he normally just— they use the mailing address, they don't use the physical over there, so I don't know if you just want an address for— yeah. Um, okay, sorry, I have to look this all up. Let's see, where is it? Okay, it is 3515 Longmire Drive, number 141, um, College Station, Texas, 77845.
[02:38] [Receptionist]: 77845. What date was the accident and where did it happen?
[02:43] [Dawn Knowles]: Um, it was on last Thursday, um, which I can't think of— I don't even know what today— 28th. So the 22nd of January. And um, it happened on the frontage road in College Station near the Nissan dealership. I guess that's the best I can tell you.
[03:07] [Receptionist]: That's okay. Okay, I'm ready. And he was a driver, right?
[03:13] [Dawn Knowles]: Yes, he was the driver. Um, they had— so do you want me to tell you about it or—
[03:21] [Receptionist]: Please.
[03:22] [Dawn Knowles]: Oh, okay. So, and he does better explaining it, but so imagine you're on the frontage road and I think there's two or three lanes. In the left lane, so that would be closest to the freeway, there was a— one of those transport car transport trucks that was um, he had I guess he had stopped or was almost stopped because he was going to have to do one of those wide turns into the Nissan dealership. My son was in the middle lane next to that and he was coming up towards that truck. And then there was a plumber's big pickup truck behind the transport truck. And I guess the plumber's pickup truck obviously realized that that truck was stopped or almost stopping and so he jumped into the lane in front of my son. My son slammed his brakes on, they locked, and he hit him. So my son, even though he was behind. So that happened. Um, there's no damage to the plumber's truck, of course, because of the big truck. They're probably going to total my son's truck just because it seems like nowadays that's what they do. They haven't decided yet. Um, but we— they called the police. Um, the police officer came out, he interviewed my son, he interviewed the plumber truck guy. He never interviewed the transport guy that was in the way of all this, which is what my issue was. And then he immediately told my son, "Okay, you're at fault." And that was it. And so then they of course exchanged insurance. My son has USAA, we have all have USAA. And so USAA right now is trying to figure out if they're going to just total the car or what they're doing. Pretty sure they're going to total it, um, just because it's a— also a— a Hilux, it's a different kind of car. Um, but I just wanted to see— I wanted to talk to Bryce mainly to see— I— I was upset because I don't understand why the police officer never interviewed the transport truck guy who was the one that was in a lane— on the very left lane that was going to go over another lane to get, you know, make that right. And so I just wanted to, you know, kind of check on that. And like I said, it may be that he can't help us, but at least I wanted to ask the questions.
[05:44] [Receptionist]: Okay. And so there was just two cars involved. No one ever hit the car transport, right, truck?
[05:51] [Dawn Knowles]: Nobody hit the car transport, no.
[05:53] [Receptionist]: Okay. And so he was not injured and he got the ticket. What— what was the ticket for?
[05:59] [Dawn Knowles]: So he got a ticket for going 45 in a 40 because he told the police officer he was going 45, which is what he said he was, you know, he was being honest. Exactly. Yeah, so on top of— yeah, so on top of everything, the police officer said, "Okay, well, you're at fault and by the way, I'm giving you this ticket for going 45 in a 40." Um, so that's what the ticket was. Oh my god. I know. I was so mad. I was like, "Really? Insult to injury." Yeah. So anyways, so he got the ticket, which of course I think is due in like a week and we'll pay that. Um, but I— like I said, I think the big— and then the plumbing truck guy, like I— I don't know, you know, what happened with that. Um, I mean, like if I asked Rocky and he said, "Yeah, there wasn't really damage to his truck because it's one of those big heavy work trucks." Right. But he— I asked him, I said, "Did you ask the police officer to talk to the transport guy?" Because he— you know, he should— he was at least a witness and honestly, in my fault— I mean, my opinion, he's the real reason it happened. But Rocky said no, he didn't talk to him at all. And also my Rocky's 26, he's young and he's a student, so I wondered if the police officer was, "You're young and..." I don't know.
[07:18] [Receptionist]: And so— he got the ticket. Okay. So let me see if I— if Bryce is in and I can tell him what's going on, okay, Ms. Dawn?
[07:28] [Dawn Knowles]: Okay, thank you.
[07:29] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. So give me a minute, okay?
[07:31] [Dawn Knowles]: Okay, thanks.
[07:32] [ ... Silence (29s) ... ]
[08:01] [Receptionist]: Okay, I'm sorry, he's not available, Ms. Dawn. What I can do is send him a message and with your phone number 805-603-9786 for him to call you.
[08:14] [Dawn Knowles]: Okay, that would be great. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
[08:18] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. And I don't know— I'm not going to lie to you and tell you he's going to call you today because I'm not sure. I don't want to lie and say, "Oh yeah, he's going to call you."
[08:25] [Dawn Knowles]: No, no, no. You never know how busy— I'm a realtor too, that's how I know Pamela and yeah, I get it, like we're all running around. But yeah, I wanted to at least get the call started. So, okay, thank you so much.
[08:37] [Receptionist]: Okay, sure. Thank you, Ms. Dawn. Bye.
[08:40] [Dawn Knowles]: Thanks, bye.
