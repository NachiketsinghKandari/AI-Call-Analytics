[00:12] [Receptionist]: Hello, thank you for calling McCraw Law Group, how can I help you?
[00:16] [Christopher McCarrell]: Yes. Um, I'm new to this whole thing. Um, I went to the dentist. Uh, tell me if I'm valid here. I went to the dentist yesterday for my first exam in 20 years. And I, uh, a couple hours later or I woke up the next day and the entire left side of my face is swollen and I can barely see.
[00:37] [Receptionist]: I'm really sorry to hear, sir. So you're looking to retain an attorney?
[00:42] [Christopher McCarrell]: I'm— don't know if there's any validity to it, but I feel like, you know, nothing was— yeah, everything was fine and then it wasn't. Yeah, I would like to try to maybe seek an attorney.
[00:53] [Receptionist]: Okay. Can I have your name with the proper spelling?
[00:57] [Christopher McCarrell]: Uh, yes. It is Cra— Christopher, C-H-R-I-S-T-I-P-H-E-R, uh, McCarrell. M-C-C-A-R-R-E-L-L.
[01:12] [Receptionist]: Okay, we need your physical address?

[01:28] [Receptionist]: Is that Collin County or Dallas?
[01:31] [Christopher McCarrell]: That's Collin County.
[01:33] [Receptionist]: Okay. We're going to need your email now?
[01:36] [Christopher McCarrell]: All right. It is, uh— this is funny. Uh, it's old. Uh, juggalo, J-U-G-G-A-L-O, 1562 at gmail.com.
[01:56] [Receptionist]: Okay. And we're going to need also your phone number?

[02:11] [Receptionist]: Cell phone, right?
[02:12] [Christopher McCarrell]: Yes.
[02:13] [Receptionist]: And how did you hear about us? Did someone refer you over?
[02:16] [Christopher McCarrell]: I got up, I could barely see, and yours was the first, uh, uh, thing I could read on the internet when I looked you up, so good on you.
[02:27] [Receptionist]: Okay. Are you located near Dallas-Fort Worth or Amarillo, Texas?
[02:36] [Christopher McCarrell]: Uh, no. We are— Wylie, Texas. We are 20 miles out of Dallas, I guess.
[02:43] [Receptionist]: Okay. And so what is the legal matter that you're looking to pursue?
[02:49] [Christopher McCarrell]: Well, I went to the dentist for the first time in years and now I, uh— do you know the show The Goonies? There's a movie called The Goonies. There's this Mongoloid character named Sloth. That's what I look like now.
[03:13] [Receptionist]: So what— right, but what is the legal matter that you're looking to pursue?
[03:18] [Christopher McCarrell]: Oh, legal matter I'm trying to pursue is that I went into the dentist, I was issued no shots, no warnings, no anything at all, and now my face is swollen and I can barely see.
[03:34] [Receptionist]: So it would be a medical malpractice you mean?
[03:37] [Christopher McCarrell]: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Like, I mean, you go to the dentist and then you have trouble seeing now, right?
[03:51] [Receptionist]: I see. I'm really sorry to hear, Mr. McCarrell. Um, unfortunately, we're unable to assist in this area, but I can refer you to attorney Colin Carboy at Carboy Law Firm. If you have a pen and paper, let me give you the number so you can give them a call.
[04:05] [Christopher McCarrell]: All right. That would— you know what? I— can I have my wife look them up? Because it's easier for her to see.
[04:12] [Receptionist]: Um, sure. So Carboy Law Firm.
[04:19] [Christopher McCarrell]: Carboy? What?
[04:22] [Receptionist]: Carboy.
[04:23] [Christopher McCarrell]: Carboys. Okay.
[04:27] [Receptionist]: Thank you for your time, sir. You have a good rest of your day.
