I'm having to pay for a rental with my money. And I cannot pay my bills because I have to rent a car and I have to pay for it. I need her insurance to take care of some of this stuff.

[02:33] [Rebecca Weaver]: They're never available. They're never available. Every time I call, they're never available. So, okay. I tried. So, I'll just have to see what I can do.

[03:03] [Rebecca Weaver]: Since they're not gonna pay. 'Cause I'm not happy. Thank you.
