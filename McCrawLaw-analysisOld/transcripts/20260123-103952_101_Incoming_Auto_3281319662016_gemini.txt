[00:04] [Speaker 1]: Hi again. Hello. Um, hey, quick question if you're able to look into your email for me, um, from sometime at November around November 5th, if Maria sent you some documents whenever you created the case for Isaiah Rodriguez?
[00:27] [Speaker 2]: November the 5th. Um, let's see.
[00:34] [Speaker 1]: What we're looking for is to see if maybe Maria sent over a copy of the contract that was signed whenever they, uh, met in person.

[00:52] [Speaker 1]: Yes.

[ ... Silence (10s) ... ]

[01:04] [Speaker 1]: Wait. Maria? Or even from me. I don't know if maybe I was sent it over to you to create...
[01:18] [Speaker 2]: I think it was you because I didn't get anything from Maria.
