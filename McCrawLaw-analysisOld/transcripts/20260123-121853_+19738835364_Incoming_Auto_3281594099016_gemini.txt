----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded.
[00:03] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, this is Jessica, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Claire Amari]: Hi, my name is Claire Amari, I am a reporter with the New York Times. I am calling because I have been trying to get in touch with y'all for a while about a case you guys are handling involving a student and an incident that occurred with an SRO in Mesquite ISD. I did speak with Paola Lopez about this in December and have exchanged a couple emails with her since. I am very interested in speaking with the attorney handling this case, mainly because we are working at the Times on a project that is relevant to what allegedly occurred there. We have a video clip of the incident that we may reference in the story and I just really want to be able to kind of share information with the legal team about what we're doing. I'm just wondering if you can connect me with someone or give me any clarity on when that might happen?
[01:12] [Receptionist]: Okay, yeah, give me one moment, let me go ahead and see if I can get you over to that attorney. If not, I can also see, I know you spoke with Paola, but we also have our Chief Marketing Officer, Yvonne. I can see if I can also connect her over to her as well. One moment.
[01:31] [Claire Amari]: That would be fantastic. Who is the lawyer working on it?
[01:35] [Receptionist]: Give me one moment. I am so sorry for that long hold there, it does look like Yvonne, our Chief Marketing Officer, as well as the attorney, Charlie Ginn, is currently unavailable. But I can go ahead and forward them a message that way they can reach out to you as soon as they can. Can I get a good callback number for you?
[01:56] [Claire Amari]: Sure. My number is 973-
[01:58] [Receptionist]: Mhm.
[01:59] [Claire Amari]: 883-
[02:00] [Receptionist]: 883-
[02:01] [Claire Amari]: 5364.
[02:02] [Receptionist]: 5364. Okay, perfect.
[02:06] [Claire Amari]: And so it sounds like Charlie Ginn is handling this?
[02:11] [Receptionist]: Yes, Charlie Ginn. Last name G-I-N-N. Okay.
[02:16] [Claire Amari]: Okay. Okay.
[02:21] [Receptionist]: And then did you also have Yvonne's email? Has Paola provided that for you?
[02:25] [Claire Amari]: I don't immediately know, but why don't you pass it along just in case so I can direct emails to her?
[02:34] [Receptionist]: Okay, perfect. Yvonne Kinser. Her email is I, then her last name, Kinser, that is K-I-N-S-E-R @ mccrawlawgroup.com.
[02:52] [Claire Amari]: .com. All right, I will email her directly and thank you for that. I appreciate it. I'll wait to hear back from her or Mr. Ginn.
[02:58] [Receptionist]: Mhm. You have a nice day.
[03:00] [Claire Amari]: Thank you, you too. Bye.
[03:02] [Receptionist]: Bye.
