[02:14] [George Groves]: Okay. Yes.
[02:18] [Receptionist]: Okay. And then you said a workers' comp. And then can you provide me with some details of the situation that happened?
[02:26] [George Groves]: Well, yeah. I, uh, previous job I worked, I was a facility manager, but in the condition of my scope of my work, I had to move a lot of furniture. And in many cases, it was required, it was required for two people to move this heavy furniture, but I was doing it by myself. On multiple occasions, I got injured while moving furniture, loading it and unloading it into vans and trucks, moving it to different locations. I, uh, reached out to my employer on several occasions and requested, well, initially I informed, I wasn't really familiar with how it goes, so I informed her of my initial injury and, uh, she basically told me to go to the doctor to get checked out, but using my own insurance. Uh, once I went to the doctor and found out that my insurance did not cover that, uh, type of, uh, visit, I informed her that, you know, my insurance doesn't cover, can you refer me to a doctor or a clinic to get checked out? She said she would check into it, didn't get back to me. I have several, I have all of the text messages of our communication since the day I started working with the company. All the work orders, especially the ones that they sent me, you know, requiring two people. I got text messages from texting her back and saying, "Hey, I'm not going to be able to lift this or load this, it's too heavy," you know, and or I can, you know, and she would send me the work order the following week to do it again. Uh, I have work orders where, I mean not work orders, text messages where I've indicated that I've injured myself or hurt myself or re-injured or I'm in severe pain, you know, due to all the lifting that I'm doing and, you know, she would say stuff like, "Wow, you need to get some rest," but turn around and send me five work orders to move more stuff. I'm talking about immediately after, or like get rest or go buy a back brace, but she never would submit in a request, uh, for a claim or anything like that. And like I said, I have all the text messages and, and, you know, from the day I started. And, uh, I went through the process with her insurance company, but they denied me today.
[04:46] [Receptionist]: Okay, so the insurance, okay. Let me, and you said the denial, you received the denial today?
[04:54] [George Groves]: Well, they called me and told, told me about the denial. He said he'll send me an email shortly.
[05:01] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me place you on a brief hold, give me just a second.
[05:05] [George Groves]: Okay.
[05:06] [ ... Silence (32s) ... ]
[05:38] [Receptionist]: Okay, so for this case, I'm actually going to provide you with a referral. Let me know when you're ready to take down that information.
[05:46] [George Groves]: All right, give me a second. Everybody keeps referring me and then I can't get through it. Okay, hold on.
