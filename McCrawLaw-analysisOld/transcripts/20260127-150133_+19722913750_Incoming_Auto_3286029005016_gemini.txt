[00:22] [Randy Weiss]: Yes.
[00:23] [Receptionist]: Are you an existing client?

[00:41] [Receptionist]: Randy, Mr. Weiss, what is the best number for us to get back with you in case we get disconnected?

[00:57] [Randy Weiss]: No, I'm going to talk to somebody and uh, and after that I'll call an attorney, but I'm hopeful just by having a simple conversation with someone they will recognize the silly mistake they made.
