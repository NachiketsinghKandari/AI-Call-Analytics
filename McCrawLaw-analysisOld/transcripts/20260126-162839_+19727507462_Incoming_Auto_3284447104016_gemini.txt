[00:08] [ ... Silence (8s) ... ]
[00:16] [Keonte Reese]: Hello?
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Hi.
[00:19] [Keonte Reese]: Hey, how you doing? Um, I was trying to see, um, I gave you guys a call earlier in the month about a lawyer for a slip and fall accident I had in Walmart.
[00:32] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me see here. Yeah, it looks like January 4th.
[00:38] [Keonte Reese]: Yes, um, I was trying to see, um, was it too late to get with you guys for representation?
[00:44] [Receptionist]: I don't believe so. Uh, best I can do since I'm a receptionist for the office, what I can do is, uh, you know, take down this information and then has anything changed regarding this slip and fall?
[00:57] [Keonte Reese]: Um, I had a lawyer, but they wanted me to go to therapy five times a week and I can't do that. So, uh, I'm looking for other representation.
[01:10] [Receptionist]: Okay, absolutely. Let me just, uh, confirm the information I have for you. Uh, what was your name?
[01:17] [Keonte Reese]: Keonte Reese, K-E-U-N-T-A-E, last name is R-E-E-S-E.
[01:24] [Receptionist]: Perfect. And your email address is here, Keonte, and that's the same spelling, first name, last name, at gmail.com?
[01:33] [Keonte Reese]: Yes.
[01:34] [Receptionist]: Perfect. And then I have your address down as 7522 Great Trinity Forest Way, apartment 2101, in Dallas?
[01:46] [Keonte Reese]: Uh, 7- 7255 Great Trinity— the numbers are wrong, but the—
[01:52] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay. Let me change that right now. So, yeah, now I have 7255 Great Trinity Way, apartment 2101, in Dallas.
[02:04] [Keonte Reese]: Is it Great Trinity Forest Way or just Great Trinity Way?
[02:08] [Receptionist]: Oh, Great Trinity Forest Way.
[02:10] [Keonte Reese]: Okay, I'm just making sure. Apartment 2101. Okay, yeah, that's perfect.
[02:14] [Receptionist]: Perfect. All right. And this was about a slip and fall.
[02:18] [ ... Silence (30s) ... ]
[02:48] [Keonte Reese]: Yeah, uh, I called them, um, they had me, I guess, sign the contract for representation. Um, they had me go out to one, um, therapy session. And when I went to that therapy session, I was literally there for about four hours. Only thing I did was fill out paperwork, sit in the waiting room, they took my height and weight, and asked me where I was hurting, and they did an X-ray of my back. And other than that, um, that was it. But they wanted me to come to therapy five times a week and I can't do that.
[03:25] [Receptionist]: I understand. I understand. So, five times a week.
[03:33] [Keonte Reese]: Yeah, and the lawyer told me, um, no, if I wanted a settlement, uh, I would have to go for those five times a week. And I was just letting him know, you know, like, you know, with having a job and things of that sort, kids, you know, I can't just up and go there every day. You know, so it was a problem. And I wanted to ask you something. Um, I was just talking to them a moment ago. He said he was going to send me an email of separation. But is that how that works?
[04:03] [Receptionist]: I wouldn't know specific details since I'm a receptionist. Basically, my job is to take down information and send it over to the team. Um, but I can definitely, definitely add that you were inquiring.
[04:16] [Keonte Reese]: Okay.
[04:18] [Receptionist]: All right. And how'd you hear about us?
[04:22] [Keonte Reese]: Um, looked you guys up on Google.
[04:25] [Receptionist]: Okay. That absolutely works. And are you located near Dallas, Fort Worth, or Amarillo, Texas? And I believe we said Dallas.
[04:36] [Keonte Reese]: Dallas.
[04:38] [Receptionist]: Perfect.
[04:40] [ ... Silence (22s) ... ]
[05:02] [Keonte Reese]: Denton, Texas.
[05:04] [Receptionist]: Sorry, what was the city?
[05:07] [Keonte Reese]: Uh, Denton, Texas.
[05:09] [Receptionist]: Dayton?
[05:10] [Keonte Reese]: No, Denton. D-E-N-T-O-N.
[05:13] [Receptionist]: Denton. My apologies.
[05:19] [Keonte Reese]: Yeah.
[05:20] [Receptionist]: And what was the date of the incident?
[05:23] [Keonte Reese]: It was on, uh, the— the 4th of this month.
[05:28] [Receptionist]: Okay, January 4th. Okay. And what injuries did you sustain?
[05:41] [Keonte Reese]: Um, it was, I've been having tension on my lower back and, uh, that day I had a little, a little knee, it was a little aching with my knees, but other than that, everything else is pretty cool.
[05:56] [Receptionist]: Okay. Well, I'll still put it here. So we had lower back and knee.
[06:01] [Keonte Reese]: Mhm.
[06:02] [Receptionist]: All right. I'm going to attempt to transfer you over. I'm going to put you on hold for just a moment.
[06:08] [ ... Silence (130s) ... ]
[08:18] [Receptionist]: Keonte?
[08:20] [Keonte Reese]: Yes.
[08:21] [Receptionist]: Hey, so looks like no one's available. Uh, let me just explain the next steps. I'm going to get all this information to our team of attorneys and have them reach back out to you, okay?
[08:31] [Keonte Reese]: All righty. Thank you.
[08:33] [Receptionist]: All right. Thank you, Keonte. Take care.
[08:36] [Keonte Reese]: You too.
