[00:38] [Lissette Bertalli]: Mine is is Betty from B.
[00:43] [Receptionist]: What was that?
[00:44] [Lissette Bertalli]: The client's name is Betty Lee.
[00:50] [Receptionist]: Okay, it looks like you're calling from an insurance company.
[00:53] [Lissette Bertalli]: Yes.
[00:56] [Receptionist]: Okay. And may I have your first and last name please?
[00:59] [Lissette Bertalli]: Lissette Bertalli.
[01:03] [Receptionist]: Alright, and I have the email it looks like ibertalli@lancerinsurance.com.
[01:09] [Lissette Bertalli]: No, no, it's L for Lissette, L-Bertalli. Okay, it could be, it's capitalized and maybe she... well, I bet she have it wrong because she's never responded to me, you know, since, you know...
[01:26] [Receptionist]: Hmm, okay. Let me check and make sure that it's L-Bertalli.
[01:30] [Lissette Bertalli]: Yes, L as in Larry, Bertalli at Lancer Insurance. And you know, she never responded to my supervisor, her name is Mary, you'll see maybe that Mary, my supervisor, emailed her once and she never responds to me, but you know what, maybe they don't represent the client anymore, so maybe you could find that out.
[01:54] [Receptionist]: Um, well I can put in the notes, um, they're not available at the moment, so I'll have to take a message, but I will put that in there to ask them. Um, what was the name of the client again?
[02:03] [Lissette Bertalli]: Yeah, ask if if they represent the client anymore because if not I'm going to close the claim because I I made I paid for the property damage already and and made an offer for the injury but they never responded, so I'm just, you know, I I'm just figuring, you know, the damage was so minor that they just didn't really take the claim.
[02:25] [Receptionist]: Okay. Alright, and what was the name of the client again?
[02:28] [Lissette Bertalli]: Betty Lee. B-E-T-T-Y L-E-E.
[02:33] [Lissette Bertalli]: Yes.
[02:34] [Receptionist]: Okay. Okay.
[02:37] [Lissette Bertalli]: So just let her know I'm going to close it, I'm going to close it. I'm going to close it because I'm thinking I see I see that I've left so many messages and then my supervisor even got involved and she's left uh email and they didn't respond, so just let her know that we're going to close the claim and we can open it again if they need it.
[02:56] [Receptionist]: Okay, will do.
[02:58] [Lissette Bertalli]: Alright, thanks. Okay, bye-bye.
[03:01] [Receptionist]: No problem, have a good day. Bye-bye.
