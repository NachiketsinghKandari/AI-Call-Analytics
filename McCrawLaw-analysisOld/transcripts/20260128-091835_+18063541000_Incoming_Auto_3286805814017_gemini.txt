[00:09] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, how can I help you?
[00:11] [Nicole Upchurch]: Yes, I was calling about a request that was submitted to us, but I'm not able to find the patient, the dad, but I know he was probably brought in, just because it was a motor vehicle accident with some children. So I was wondering if you guys might could get a hold of the patient and see if he was listed under an alias name or if he had a medical record number or something.
[00:31] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me go ahead and collect the specifics. Um, can I get your first and last name, please?
[00:37] [Nicole Upchurch]: Nicole Upchurch.
[00:41] [Receptionist]: Give me one second. Is that Nicole with the C-H?
[00:42] [Nicole Upchurch]: No, sir. N-I-C-O-L-E.
[00:45] [Receptionist]: Thank you. Upchurch, U-P-C-H-U-R-C-H?
[00:48] [Nicole Upchurch]: Yes.
[00:49] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Thank you. And, uh, I'm sorry, where are you calling us from?
[00:52] [Nicole Upchurch]: Northwest Texas Healthcare.
[00:55] [Receptionist]: Give me one second.
[00:58] [ ... Silence (5s) ... ]
[01:03] [Receptionist]: And a phone number and email to reach out, please?
[01:07] [Nicole Upchurch]: 806-354-1785, option one, then option three. And did you ask for an email, you said?
[01:19] [Receptionist]: Yes, please. But for some— I'm sorry, that was 806-354-1785, option one and then option three?
[01:26] [Nicole Upchurch]: Yes.
[01:27] [Receptionist]: Okay. Thank you. And a good email, please?
[01:29] [Nicole Upchurch]: N-W-T-H-R-O-I at M-R-O-C-O-R-P as in pineapple dot com.
[01:46] [Receptionist]: N-W-T-H-R-O-I and then just to confirm, that's N as in Nancy, W, T as in Tango, H-R-O-I at M as in Mary, R-O-C-O-R-P as in Papa dot com?
[01:58] [Nicole Upchurch]: Yes.
[02:00] [Receptionist]: Okay. Thank you. One second.
[02:01] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[02:07] [Receptionist]: And what is the information that you said you needed?
[02:11] [Nicole Upchurch]: Well, the patient's name on the request is Ryan Bullard, but I don't find him in our medical records system since 2024. But I'm pretty sure that he was brought in, so I'm thinking he might have been brought in under an alias name, if they can get that name or the medical record number.
[02:31] [Receptionist]: Okay. Give me one second.
[02:32] [ ... Silence (19s) ... ]
[02:51] [Receptionist]: You said either the alias or the medical record. How do you spell Ryan's last name?
[02:56] [Nicole Upchurch]: B as in boy, U-L-L-A-R-D as in dog.
[03:02] [Receptionist]: Thank you. And the first name, R-Y-A-N?
[03:05] [Nicole Upchurch]: Yes.
[03:06] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Thank you very much. Let me go ahead and take a message and I'll go ahead and relay your request, okay?
[03:10] [Nicole Upchurch]: Alrighty. Thank you.
[03:12] [Receptionist]: Thank you for your time. Have a blessed day.
[03:14] [Nicole Upchurch]: You too. Bye.
[03:15] [Receptionist]: Bye now.
