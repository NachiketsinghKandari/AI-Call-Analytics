[00:07] [Speaker 2]: It's coming through now. Is it working? Okay.
[00:10] [Zane]: Yeah, at least, I don't know, call came through for me.
[00:13] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, that's weird.
[00:15] [Zane]: Okay. Um, I wonder if others are getting it too.
[00:23] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, let me ask them and then I think I might try calling and see if they're able to answer too.
