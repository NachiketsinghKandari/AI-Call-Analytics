[01:04] [Lisa]: So this is a newer loss for us, uh, so I wanted to confirm injuries and facts. And I will say, I've I've tried calling you guys twice before and left messages, I've faxed our acknowledgment letter, and our insureds are still receiving final notice letters from your office, so I do need to touch base with somebody to confirm you have our info and all.
