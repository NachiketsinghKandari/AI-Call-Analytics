[00:29] [ ... Silence (15s) ... ]
[00:44] [Dr. Kershen]: Just to see where we are on this because I've faxed my invoice and all the medical records I believe. Wondering if they're still being treated or if they've been released and you're at the negotiation part yet. Can I give you a couple of names?

[02:32] [Dr. Kershen]: Is there, can you not transfer me to the case manager?
[02:37] [Receptionist]: For now, I will need to take a message. That's correct. But I'll take a message for you right away.
[02:48] [Dr. Kershen]: Okay. Let them know I'm wondering if the case has been, if they're still being treated or not.
