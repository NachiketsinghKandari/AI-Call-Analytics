[00:16] [Robert Harris]: Well yes, I'm in Sachse and I have a... [laughter] some legal issues as far as code violations and things that I need to get some legal help with. Is that... something we can do and in at this point I got some appeal process and just need to talk to somebody about everything.
[00:42] [Receptionist]: Okay. I'm going to need a few details to start. May I have your first and last name with spelling please?
[00:48] [Robert Harris]: It's Robert Harris.
[00:53] [Receptionist]: Harris, H-A-R-R-I-S?
[00:57] [Robert Harris]: That's correct, yes.
[00:58] [Receptionist]: And a good phone number for you?
[00:59] [Robert Harris]: 972-897-9827.
[01:07] [Receptionist]: Okay. And do you have a good email?
[01:11] [Robert Harris]: It is R-O-B-T-E-R-H-A-R-R-I-S at gmail dot com.
[01:21] [Receptionist]: I have R-O-B and then G for golf, E-R?
[01:27] [Robert Harris]: T... for Terry. R-O-B and T-E-R and Harris H-A-R-R-I-S at gmail dot com.
[01:40] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much. And your physical address?
[01:45] [Robert Harris]: 6713 Valley View Lane in Sachse.
[01:52] [Receptionist]: Do you have the zip code?
[01:54] [Robert Harris]: 75048.
[01:57] [Receptionist]: Thank you. Okay, now I understand you need help with... um... code violations you said? Would you mind just briefly describing what happened or how we can help you?
[02:09] [Robert Harris]: Well, I have code violations in Sachse, I have code violations in Dallas, I have appeal process in Dallas, and I have some ADA violations that need to be addressed.
[02:27] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, when you say code violations, do you mean... like...
[02:33] [Robert Harris]: Outside storage, junk vehicles, they they want me to remove everything from my property.
[02:41] [Receptionist]: Okay, gotcha. Um, may I ask how you heard about us?
[02:45] [Robert Harris]: Uh, just did internet search for attorneys in close my area and you're in Wylie which is not too far and it seemed like you didn't specialize in a particular, you know, injury or family or whatever that I could see but uh it seemed like that uh possibly uh this firm could help me.
[03:21] [Receptionist]: Okay, gotcha. So I just want to confirm, has anyone been injured?
[03:26] [Robert Harris]: No. It's nothing to do with accidents like that, so no. I've had some in the past but that didn't help any either.
[03:39] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um... so I just want to confirm, were you given like a citation for these violations or...
[03:49] [Robert Harris]: Yes, it's it's pretty involved, so yes.
[03:57] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um... I'm just trying to see how we can best assist. Would you mind just telling me briefly exactly what happened?
[04:07] [Robert Harris]: [laughter] Again, it's it's pretty involved. Okay, so for city of Sachse, uh, not sure how long ago it was, I get uh code officers come out, they get a warrant, they uh give me tickets for outside storage, I go to city court, of course that was useless, they they found against me, I get fines and uh then they uh come out uh another warrant, uh threaten me with more fines and they want to abate uh everything from my property and so that's in process. I do not have citation with them right now but they uh obviously uh will continue. In city of Dallas, um, same thing, citations, warrants, came out, gone to court, gone against me and I am trying to do an appeal process and I need help with it. So at a minimum would be somebody expert in appeal process to give me some help.
[05:28] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. Okay, so we would be unable to assist with that. I do have the number for the Dallas Bar Association, they'll be able to give you—
[05:37] [Robert Harris]: No they won't help. No they won't. So thank you very much. Is there nobody local here, Sachse or Wylie?
[05:43] [Receptionist]: I don't have a a referral at this time, I do apologize.
[05:49] [Robert Harris]: Can you ask any lawyers in your firm and give me a call back?
[05:56] [Receptionist]: I will let them know you asked. I can't promise they'll have one, but I'll let them know you asked, okay?
[06:01] [Robert Harris]: Well thank you very much. Appreciate that.
[06:04] [Receptionist]: Take great care.
[06:05] [Robert Harris]: Bye.
