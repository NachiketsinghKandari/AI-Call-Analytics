[02:41] [Receptionist]: Perfect. Thank you so much. Appreciate that info. And could you tell me a bit about the matter that he needs assistance with?
[02:50] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, so we were at, um, Trane, uh, manufacturer heating and air conditioning. We were at a warehouse yesterday and, uh, he was in their warehouse and slipped and fell, uh, by the bay door. Uh, he hurt his side and he broke his wrist. He broke the bone and moved another bone over. He's got to have surgery Thursday. Uh, yeah. And, yeah, they had nothing down to prevent slip and fall. They had no, you know, no ice. And, yeah, some of these, uh, got on the sealed concrete floor, his feet just came out from under him. I seen the whole thing.
[03:41] [Receptionist]: And he was in the warehouse? And this was in the warehouse when this happened?
[03:45] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yes. Yeah, he was in the warehouse at Trane. We were backed up to the dock, we had backed up to two docks, one and three. He was at dock three. Uh, he had his truck backed up to that dock and we were, uh, kept calling for somebody to come over and help us with the forklift to lift the concrete pad. And the guys looked at me and ignored me and went the other way. I yelled at three or four times. So we picked it up, moved it from dock one to dock three to put it in that truck. Uh, and when he was getting back out of the truck and got back into the warehouse as he started to walk, his feet came out from under him and that's what happened.
[04:29] [Receptionist]: Oh, I'm so sorry.
[04:31] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, he fell pretty hard. Yeah, when he hit the fan that was by the bay door, it bent the housing on the fan. I seen that today because I was back in there picking up a unit there. And he hit that and he rolled. I was wondering how he got twisted up, but it rolled him over, flipped him over, and then to keep from hitting his head, why his wrist, his right hand, and it snapped the bone in two and pushed over both bones. Yeah, it was a mess.
[05:02] [Receptionist]: Oh goodness. And may I ask how you heard about us? Was it referral or did you find us online or billboard?
[05:11] [Glenn Mitroff]: Online, Google. Glenn Adams was my, uh, family lawyer. Yeah, and he deals with all my, my other cases when I need him. He's for the last 27 years, 28. Yeah, since '97. So...
[05:34] [Receptionist]: Oh wow.
[05:35] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, I was going to say I feel like '97 was just 10 years ago and it's not. I keep forgetting that.
[05:42] [Receptionist]: Yeah, and anyway, so he's been our family attorney since then and one of them and, uh, he referred me to you guys years ago and I've used you all a few times for Alex.
[05:58] [Glenn Mitroff]: And was he working at this warehouse or was he just picking up something?
[06:04] [Receptionist]: No, we were picking stuff up. We were picking up equipment to take to customers.
[06:10] [Glenn Mitroff]: Oh goodness. And they had no slip and fall protocol, no signs out, no nothing, right?
[06:17] [Receptionist]: No, no slip, no no, no nothing, nada. They didn't even have anything out today, no ice melt, no nothing, when I went back today and walking up to the door, still solid ice. Yeah, the parking lot, the walkway. And...
[06:33] [Glenn Mitroff]: And this was in, uh, Lavon?
[06:35] [Receptionist]: No, this happened at the Mesquite branch, uh, the Dallas address. Yeah, but they call it the Mesquite location for Trane. Uh, yeah. And then after he's laying on the ground screaming and yelling, uh, and then he gets up and can't move his, his hand and it's letting it hang in pain and bent over. And then the guy that loaded the truck, this older guy, walks up, asks what happened. I told him, well, he fell. And that's when this is going to be a mess if he broke that thing, you know, for y'all's insurance and possibly mine, but I don't see where it'd go on my liability because I didn't, it wasn't my location, it was theirs.
[07:23] [Receptionist]: It was theirs, yeah. May I ask the date of when he broke his wrist?
[07:27] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yesterday. He called the, well, he called the warehouse manager, he told him what had happened. He gave me the guy's name and number and that's it. They didn't take any kind of report, but I took a few pictures. And that was it. Yeah, they offered no other assistance. He looked at him, he said, 'Oh, he'll be all right.' I'm like, 'No, I don't think so, dude. I'm pretty sure it's broke.' He couldn't drive. He got in the truck, he tried to, he's like, 'Dad, I can't drive. The pain's too bad.' I said, 'Well, get in my truck, I'll take you to the closest hospital.' So he did, he got in the back seat. I took him to the closest hospital, which was White Rock Hospital down on, uh, Garland Road and Buckner. Yeah, sure enough, it was broke, just what I thought.
[08:21] [Receptionist]: Oh my goodness. What date did this happen on? I know he has surgery Thursday.
[08:25] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yesterday. I can even tell you what time. I took pictures from when you look at the timestamp on the pictures. I'll tell you exactly what time it was. Uh, I took the pictures at 2:01. It happened probably less than five minutes before that. So, they've got cameras all over that place, inside and out. So, I would definitely request the cameras. They're not going to give them to me, but y'all could request them. And I'm sure they've got time and date on them too. The name and number that he gave me for the warehouse manager, I can give you that.
[09:11] [Receptionist]: It looks like I'm not asking for it at this time yet. If you don't mind, I can see if I can try to grab somebody for you. Would that be okay?
[09:23] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, because he's, he asked me earlier if anybody called back, because I talked to one yesterday and I said, 'No, I haven't heard anything.' So that's why I'm calling.
[09:33] [Receptionist]: Okay, well let me, can I put you on a...
[09:36] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah.
[09:37] [Receptionist]: Can I put you on a brief hold and then I can try to grab somebody for you, sir?
[09:43] [Glenn Mitroff]: Yeah, thank you.
[09:45] [Receptionist]: You're very welcome.
[09:47] [ ... Silence (59s) ... ]
[10:48] [Receptionist]: Thank you for the hold. I'm going to try to get a hold of someone else. I just don't want to leave you on for too long. Give me just another moment, sir.
[10:56] [Glenn Mitroff]: Thank you.
[10:58] [Receptionist]: Mhm.

[11:42] [Receptionist]: Okay, I apologize about the long wait. Let me explain next steps. I'm going to get all this information to our team of attorneys and have them reach back out to you, okay?
