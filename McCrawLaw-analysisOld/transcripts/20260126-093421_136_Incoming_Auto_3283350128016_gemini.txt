----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Automated Voice]: This call is being recorded.
[00:05] [Speaker 1]: Hi there.
[00:06] [Speaker 2]: Hey girly. Um...
[00:08] [Speaker 1]: Good morning. How are you?
[00:11] [Speaker 2]: I'm good, how are you?
[00:12] [Speaker 1]: Good. I was gonna Teams you about it—
[00:16] [Speaker 2]: Kayla Franco? Or what's her name?
[00:19] [Speaker 1]: Katie. I was gonna talk to you about that, but I just feel weird Teamsing it. I don't know. Um, so I know that Derek is learning and stuff, but yeah, so I've had two cases come in, no date of birth, wrong phone number. Um, so Yaylee's, um, she put in the emergency contact's phone number, um, and she didn't put a date of birth, you know, the last name was misspelled. And then with Katie, um, an address is not in there, it just says McKinney, Texas, so like the full address is not in there, date of birth is not in there. So I'm, I don't mind doing it, it's just—
[01:12] [Speaker 2]: Okay. No, no, no, don't do it. I will let her know.
[01:15] [Speaker 1]: Okay. And so would you prefer us tell you or tell her directly? I just, I don't want to, you know, I don't know what you like or you prefer, so I don't want to step on toes or anything and I don't want to sound like, you know!
[01:32] [Speaker 2]: No, no, no, it's fine. And whatever you prefer, if you prefer to tell me directly, that's fine. And or if you feel better going directly to her, that's fine also. That way, like, I feel like sometimes I'm like, "Hey, remember to add this," that way they don't think it's just me, like, yes, case managers are noticing because they need these things, you know? Yeah.
[01:51] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, and I think, um, I don't know if the other girls have noticed anything, but I've noticed that and stuff that she's, you know, doing. And I know she's new, like I said, I know she's new, I know she's training and so I just want to get your preference on like, do you want us going directly to you, do you want us going directly to her? Just because sometimes it's better if they hear it from, you know, their, um, their supervisor or something like that. If not, if you don't mind, then I don't mind either. I just, I just want to know, you know, what your preference is.
[02:22] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, I don't mind you tell— letting them know directly, or even if you want to do a group chat.
[02:27] [Speaker 1]: Okay.
[02:28] [Speaker 2]: Because sometimes I'm like, "Dang it, I hope they don't think I'm nagging them too much as well."
[02:33] [Speaker 1]: No, yeah. I got it.
[02:34] [Speaker 2]: Because case managers do need these things, so I hope they don't think I'm just sitting here and like, nitpicking everything they do, because this stuff is needed.
[02:43] [Speaker 1]: Right. And that's the other thing too, I don't want to sound like I'm the one nitpicking, but it's just, you know, it's stuff that she's doing in there. But I just wanted to bring it to your attention. I can talk to her as well. Um, no issues, just wanted to make sure, you know, wanted to make sure what your preference was and what your process— processes are, so.
[03:03] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, either way. Um, but if you want for these two, I'll let her know. Can you just send me a Teams of what you noticed was missing?
[03:14] [Speaker 1]: Okay. Um, yeah, because on Yaylee's it won't matter anymore because I already went in and did it. I should have asked you first, so I apologize. But on this one... I did send out Yaylee's, um, authorizations.
[03:31] [Speaker 2]: Mhm.
[03:32] [Speaker 1]: Yes, I saw that in there in the file. So thank you for that.
[03:35] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, and I'm so sorry about that on the name spelling. That was probably my fault. She came in during my weekend.
[03:42] [Speaker 1]: Oh, gotcha. Because her intake is spelled correctly.
[03:46] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Yeah, because in the— the whenever on whenever we input the DocuSign, it doesn't let them change the name, but on the intake they can input whatever name, but on signatures they can't change.
[04:07] [Speaker 1]: Gotcha.
[04:09] [Speaker 2]: But, so sorry about that. And I was going to talk to you about Katie Franco anyways, because I think you've had mom before, Maria de la Garza? Or was that Esther?
[04:25] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, I had— well, Esther had her and then I got her daughter, but I still spoke to mom anyway.
[04:32] [Speaker 2]: Oh, okay. Um, you said on Katie it was date of birth, phone number, and address?
[04:40] [Speaker 1]: Uh, just incomplete address and date of birth. No, phone number's fine.
[04:44] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Okay, I will ask her to go back in and create that. Um, or add that in. I also wanted to talk to you about this case anyway. Honestly, I don't think there's going to be a source of recovery. Um, we kind of took it on because mom just didn't know what to do to help them out and see if we could investigate. Um, but this girl is 28 years old, I don't think she really knows what's going on, like, at any time, because she had this car that has a lien on it and she was telling mom this entire time, "No, I do have insurance on it. The lienor gave me insurance." Right? But then the letter that she sent from the lienor is they placed a, um, CPI insurance, which I think it's a... I don't...
[05:41] [Speaker 1]: I think it's just coverage for like collision and, and I can't remember what, but I was looking at it this morning.
[05:49] [Speaker 2]: Yeah. Um, they placed this on there because she never got— you know how you buy a car and you have to have full coverage on it? She never got it. So this entire time she thought they were just giving her this insurance when she bought the car.
[06:01] [Speaker 1]: Got it.
[06:02] [Speaker 2]: And mom says that she attempted to add this car onto their Allstate policy and, like, it would not let them. And then, I don't know, but it ended up being a rollover, so Drake said we should take it on and investigate, especially since they're previous clients. Yeah. But I'm not very hopeful on coverage, but just wanted to let you know.
[06:26] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, I was looking at it this morning and I was talking to Drake about it and maybe we can hit mom's insurance if they still live together. So like a resident relative type deal. Um, and we might be able to hit mom's policy, which I'm pretty sure she had minimum, but I'm going to ask for like, you know, updated stuff from her. I mean, I don't know how that's going to go. I mean, she's— she's 28 years old, she should be able to handle her own stuff, but you know, mom was the one that called in, which that when I saw that I was like, "Come on now."
[07:00] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, they were both— I ended up talking to Katie more. Um, so that's why we put her number there, so she does answer, but she has mom on the phone with her as well. And then I'm like, "Katie, would you rather speak in Spanish or English?" And then she's like, "Spanish." So then I'm talking to mom the entire time in Spanish and then Katie will answer me back in English, so then I talk to her in English.
[07:21] [Speaker 1]: Oh my goodness.
[07:22] [Speaker 2]: You gotta— you gotta be consistent, Katie.
[07:24] [Speaker 1]: I know.
[07:25] [Speaker 2]: Because she doesn't understand Spanish, but then if you're talking to mom you have to talk in Spanish.
[07:29] [Speaker 1]: Yeah, Maria doesn't, yeah.
[07:31] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, but she's really sweet. She's a really sweet lady. Um, and she seems to have more of a grasp on things than, you know, now that she's been through this herself, her daughter, and now this other daughter.
[07:45] [Speaker 1]: So she kind of knows and she gets it, but I can talk to both if need be. But, um, I just wanted to let you know that, but thank you. I appreciate it. Well, see, maybe— maybe we'll get a recovery from— for this one. Maybe. Hopefully.
[08:00] [Speaker 2]: All right. If you happen to talk to anybody that's in office, let me know.
[08:05] [Speaker 1]: I will let you— yes, I will let you know. Like I said, Charlie said he was going to be in, but uh, I don't know, Charlie.
[08:12] [Speaker 2]: I— I doubt it.
[08:14] [Speaker 1]: Yeah. But we'll see.
[08:17] [Speaker 2]: All right. Talk to you later.
[08:19] [Speaker 1]: Yes, bye.
[08:20] [Speaker 2]: Bye.
