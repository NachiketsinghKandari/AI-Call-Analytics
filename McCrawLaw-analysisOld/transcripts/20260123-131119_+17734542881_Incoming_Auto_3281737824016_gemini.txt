[00:18] [Regina Jones]: Hi, my name is Regina Jones. I'm a client of Todd's and Mary. Is Mary available? I mean, she's probably not, so I probably don't have to leave a message. Which is fine.
[00:28] [Receptionist]: I'll be happy to check. I'll be happy to check for you. Uh, let me go ahead, if she's not available, I'll be happy to get a message over. It'll just take me a moment to check.
