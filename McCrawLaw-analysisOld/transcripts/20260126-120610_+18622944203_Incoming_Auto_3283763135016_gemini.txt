[00:13] [Emma]: Hello, um, my name is Emma, I'm calling from Athens, we're third-party insurance claims handling company, um, and I'm not sure if I have the right office, um, but I'm trying to follow up on an email we received, we had no, um, like callback number for the person who was, um, following up, um, but we received a call from Liz Garcia and, um, regarding the claimants, I believe, uh, Lanellia Emanuel and Demetrice Johnson.
[00:44] [Receptionist]: Can you spell those names for me again?

[02:19] [Receptionist]: Okay. I don't have a team member to address this right now, but I'll certainly get a message over to them and let them know that you were following up on that email that you received. Okay?
[02:31] [Emma]: Okay. Um, I'm just curious, like, I— because I'm honestly not even sure if you guys were the ones who were following up. Do you know if you have a Liz Garcia at your office?
[02:41] [Receptionist]: I'm not seeing it in my list, but that certainly doesn't mean that we don't have them, um, in our office. So that's why I'm going to take a message and turn it over to another teammate so they can really look into it. Okay?
[02:53] [Emma]: Okay. All right. Thank you. I appreciate that.
[02:56] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Thank you. Bye.
