----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 3]: This call is being recorded for purposes.

[00:05] [ ... Silence (13s) ... ]

[00:18] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, how can I help you?
[00:21] [Eric Degler]: Yes, I'm looking for a lawyer.
[00:26] [Receptionist]: Okay. What type of case would this be, sir?
[00:31] [Eric Degler]: Uh, a ticket. And I for— there was something that the court wanted me to do that I forgot to do. And, uh, I don't like that expression. I wish I could find a different wording for it.
[00:46] [Receptionist]: Oh, I gotcha. No problem. All right. Well, yeah, let me get some info from you and we'll, we'll see how we can help you. Um, what's your name, sir?
[00:54] [Eric Degler]: Eric Degler.
[00:58] [Receptionist]: Degler. Is it D-E-G-L-E-R?
[01:03] [Eric Degler]: Yes it is. Very good. Most people can't do that kind of vowel work. As many time I've told people German vowels and Spanish vowels are the same. You don't have to change anything for 'em.
[01:18] [Receptionist]: And sir, this number you're calling from, is that a— is this your phone number that you're calling from?
[01:23] [Eric Degler]: Yeah, that's my— that's my cell phone number. Excuse me?
[01:27] [Receptionist]: I said okay. Go ahead.
[01:31] [Receptionist]: Um, and then one other thing I needed was your email.
[01:36] [Eric Degler]: Hmm?
[01:38] [Receptionist]: Uh, email address?
[01:41] [Eric Degler]: Eric Degler 1953 at gmail dot com.
[01:51] [Receptionist]: Okay. All right. And then you were saying, um, it was about a ticket and there was something else also?
[01:58] [Eric Degler]: Yeah, well there was something else I forgot to do. Um, what the judge is asking for is a copy of liability insurance valid on date citation was issued. Well, that's what the ticket was for because I didn't have insurance at that time.
[02:14] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay. I gotcha. So yeah, you don't have a way to—
[02:17] [Eric Degler]: He's actually even thanked me for making his job easy.
[02:22] [Receptionist]: Yeah. So—
[02:24] [Eric Degler]: I mean, I try to keep my composure on things like that.
[02:28] [Receptionist]: I gotcha. And sir, we got a couple different locations. Um, are you closer to Dallas or Amarillo?
[02:45] [Eric Degler]: Oh, I am in Valle de Oro.
[02:52] [Receptionist]: Okay. Is that— sorry, is that closer to Dallas or Amarillo?
[02:56] [Eric Degler]: Hmm?
[02:57] [Receptionist]: So would that be—
[03:01] [Receptionist]: Because I'm just trying to figure out which, which office to put this in. So are you, are you better off in Dallas or Amarillo?
[03:07] [Eric Degler]: I think I'm better off in Amarillo for the moment, but the court case is in Abernathy.
[03:14] [Receptionist]: Abernathy. Okay. Yeah, I mean we can cover the whole state, so that shouldn't be a problem.
[03:21] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Well, I'm— well, that's good to know. I needed to hear that. Um, I live on Tascosa Road. I'm closer to Boys Ranch than I am to Amarillo. I'm stuck right in between the two.
[03:41] [Eric Degler]: I'm supposed to show up on March 26th, 2026 at 9:30 AM.
[03:51] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[03:52] [Eric Degler]: Justice of the Peace located on I-27 and Farm Market 54 in Abernathy. I paid the ticket. I was on time with that. And I guess I was under the illusion that that was going to be it. You pay it and that's the end of it. But then she knows I have insurance, but she wants copy of the liability insurance, which I still have and maintained it since.
[04:26] [Receptionist]: And sir, where did you say the ticket was from?
[04:29] [Eric Degler]: Abernathy.
[04:31] [Receptionist]: Abernathy.
[04:33] [Eric Degler]: Straight down 27. It's not that far south of Canyon. Well, it is and it isn't, all according to your perspective on that, I guess.
[04:46] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[04:56] [Eric Degler]: And $144 state fee cashier's check or money order. Affidavit signed and notarized copy of driver's license record.
[05:09] [Receptionist]: Okay. So sir, for these issues, um, because I'm just going through the intake process here, so at this time we're not taking cases for, for traffic tickets right now. So I got a number I can refer you to though that will be able to help you.
[05:28] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Yeah, that would help. I don't like going into court without representation.
[05:33] [Receptionist]: Yeah, let me give you this number. Um, this'll— you'll be able to— yeah, we're just— I'm sorry about that. Yeah, we're just not doing the traffic cases right now. Um, but yeah, let me know when you're ready for that number.
[05:45] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Yeah, I am.
[05:49] [Receptionist]: So that is 214-220-7400.
[05:56] [Eric Degler]: 214. Where is that?
[05:58] [Receptionist]: I'm not sure exactly where that is, but—
[06:02] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I'm not sure exactly what area code that is.
[06:05] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Okay. Could you give me that number again, please?
[06:09] [Receptionist]: Yeah, 214-220-7400.
[06:19] [Eric Degler]: 7400. And who would that be for?
[06:23] [Receptionist]: That's for the Dallas Bar Association. So they can, they can refer you to a lawyer that's taking the, uh, traffic cases right now.
[06:32] [Eric Degler]: Oh. Okay. Maybe you can answer me a question. Um, there's a lawyer I used to use all the time. I went down to his office, but the only thing that's left there is the building. Uh, Ronald Spriggs?
[06:52] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I'm not— I'm not sure who that is.
[06:56] [Eric Degler]: Well, he's a local lawyer here in Amarillo.
[07:01] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I guess he's— maybe he closed up shop. I'm not sure.
[07:06] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. Well, that's what I was thinking. I called him— I've called him a few times, never gotten an answer. Then one day he called me back, said call me back. And I've been trying ever since and still can't reach him. He did talk about moving to Maryland.
[07:24] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I was going to say maybe he moved. Yeah, maybe. I'm not sure.
[07:29] [Eric Degler]: Mhm.
[07:30] [Receptionist]: All right, sir. Well, thanks for calling in and, uh—
[07:36] [Eric Degler]: Yeah. The way the country's going right now, it's fucking scary.
[07:41] [Receptionist]: Oh yeah. No, it's crazy right now.
[07:45] [Eric Degler]: Yeah, well Jesse Ventura put it perfectly. He says we are a third world country now. Not only that, but, you know, this whole thing that with ICE and all that.
[08:01] [Eric Degler]: He said look at Nazi Germany during the 1930s. That's what— that's what we're doing. And I, being a history buff, I couldn't disagree with that. But World War II is not my strong suit. The Civil War is my strong suit. You know.
[08:19] [Receptionist]: Yeah. All right, sir. Well, give that number a call. They'll be able to get it figured out for you and, uh, yeah, thanks for calling in and, uh, have a great day, okay?
[08:29] [Eric Degler]: Mhm.
[08:31] [Receptionist]: All right. Bye-bye now, sir.
[08:33] [Eric Degler]: They'll be able to help out with someone here in Amarillo or possibly even Abernathy, I guess.
[08:41] [Receptionist]: That's the bar, so I mean, yeah, they'll have— they got, you know, contact info for attorneys all over the state.
[08:48] [Eric Degler]: Okay. And what is it called again? The Dallas Bar?
[08:52] [Receptionist]: Dallas Bar Association.
[08:56] [Eric Degler]: Okay.
[08:57] [Receptionist]: All right, sir. Well, thanks for calling in and, uh, have a good day.
[09:03] [Eric Degler]: I've been fighting the government all day over my retirement. They offer you things, they talk to you about things, oh you qualify this, you qualify that, and then you find out after a couple hours that you never actually were qualified for anything. It's a real mess this retirement. It's not what people think it is. Trust you me.
[09:26] [Receptionist]: Yeah. What I'm looking to do is just get this—
[09:28] [Eric Degler]: Ticket taken care of without having to show up there 9:30 in the morning. Um—
[09:38] [Receptionist]: I understand. And I'm sorry we couldn't be more help for you. I'm going to have to let you go though, sir. I got a lot of calls on hold here.
[09:45] [Eric Degler]: Okay.
[09:47] [Receptionist]: Have a good one.
[09:48] [Eric Degler]: Yep. Bye-bye.
