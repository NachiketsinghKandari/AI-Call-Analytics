----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Unknown]: This call is being recorded.
[00:05] [Receptionist]: Good afternoon, McCraw Law Group, this is Maria. May I help you?
[00:08] [Eduardo Garza]: Yes, Maria, this is Eduardo Garza. Um, uh, I just have a case, a worker's comp— worker's comp case. It's been over two years now and, um, the company or the insurance company, they're, uh, denying me from having my surgery when I already had two, two MRIs done and clearly it shows there that my, uh, meniscus is torn and, uh, still having trouble, you know. I don't know. I already told my attorney that I want to settle, you know, so I can try to get insurance myself and do the surgery myself, you know. I was wondering, uh, how much would the settlement be like, you know what I mean?
[00:46] [Receptionist]: Are you one of our clients? At— no, you're not one of our clients. But do you have an attorney?
[00:51] [Eduardo Garza]: No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, I do have one in Ohio. Because I'm from Texas, right? But I was contracted to go work over there in a company and I got hurt. I fell over with a 50-pound box of potato and got injured.
[01:02] [Receptionist]: Mm-hmm. Sorry about that.
[01:04] [Eduardo Garza]: Yes, ma'am.
[01:05] [Receptionist]: I cannot answer that. You'd have to speak to your attorney since you're already being represented.
[01:12] [Eduardo Garza]: Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, no, that's no problem. Uh, because, um, if I get offered like $50,000, um, half of that, if I owe child support, half of that automatically goes to child support, right?
[01:25] [Receptionist]: I can't answer that. I'm not sure.
[01:28] [Eduardo Garza]: Oh, you're not? Oh, okay. Um, sorry about that. No, it's all right.
[01:31] [Receptionist]: No, it's all good. It's just I can't answer questions like that.
[01:35] [Eduardo Garza]: Okay. Okay. Thank you, ma'am. Have a nice weekend.
[01:38] [Receptionist]: You're welcome and good luck. Thank you for calling in, Eduardo. Cuídate. Okay.
[01:42] [Eduardo Garza]: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. God bless you, Maria. Bye.
[01:44] [Receptionist]: Okay. Bye.
