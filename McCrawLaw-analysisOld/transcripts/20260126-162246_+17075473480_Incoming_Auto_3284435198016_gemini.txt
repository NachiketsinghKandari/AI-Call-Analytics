[01:41] [ ... Silence (29s) ... ]
[02:11] [Receptionist]: Alrighty, Carla, thank you very much for your patience. Uh, Carla, I apologize, it seems that I would need to take a message for you at this time. Uh, but don't worry, I'll make sure to pass it over to the appropriate team right away so they can verify this client's details for you. Uh, do you have an email where they could follow up with you or your phone number is fine?
[02:31] [Karla]: Um, the phone number is fine, um, but you do have her in the sys— in your system. 'Cause we have a request from you guys and we just wanted to confirm.
[02:41] [Receptionist]: Yeah, definitely. Well, since I'm the receptionist, for privacy of the cases, I don't have access to the files. So I'm not able to confirm it myself. Sorry. Uh, but I'll make sure the legal team reviews this as soon as they can and I'll pass it along side your phone number so they can follow up with you, okay?
[02:56] [Karla]: Okay. And what is your name?
