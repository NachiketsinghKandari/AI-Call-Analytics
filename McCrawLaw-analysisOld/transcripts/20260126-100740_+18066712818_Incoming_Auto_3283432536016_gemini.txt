[00:00] [Unknown]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, this is Jessica, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Kathy Powell]: Jessica, this is Kathy Powell and, uh, you've been sending me some DocuSigns for a lawsuit, so to speak. Uh, I just did not receive any kind of injuries in that, uh, rear-end accident that happened on January 2nd with Joe. Now, Joe is still in pain, but I didn't receive anything that, uh, I need to file for any kind of injury. So, that's why I've kind of been, I've really been dragging my feet and I was going, "Whoa, you know, I'm just really not in pain or nothing happened to me." So...
[00:52] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[00:53] [Kathy Powell]: ...that's why I haven't. So.
[00:57] [Receptionist]: Okay, give me one moment, let me go ahead and, um, connect you over. Um, can I get your first and last name one more time?
