[00:48] [Receptionist]: All right. And were you needing a case status update on that client?
[00:52] [Garrick]: Yes.
[00:54] [Receptionist]: Okay. All right. So I'm unable to access client files, so I cannot, uh, look in and see what updates we have. And I don't have anyone available right now for you to speak with, so I will just have the team follow up with you as soon as they're able. Is the best callback still the 972-855-6273?
[01:11] [Garrick]: Yes. And what's your name?
[01:13] [Receptionist]: Sure. My name is Kira, K-I-R-A.
[01:17] [Garrick]: All right. And is there an email for your office?
[01:21] [Receptionist]: Um, let me see. Do you know who is working on the case? Because I have their emails individually, but I don't have like a generic email to give out.
[01:33] [Garrick]: Diane. Or excuse me, no, not Diane. I'm so sorry. I... hold on. I'm working on this and had another thing pulled up. Hold on.
[01:44] [Receptionist]: No, you're fine.
[01:47] [Garrick]: Hold on, let me go back.
[01:51] [Receptionist]: You're fine.
[01:53] [ ... Silence (15s) ... ]
[02:09] [Garrick]: Lambert.
[02:12] [Receptionist]: Lambert? All right, let me see. Um... is it L-A-M-B-E-R-T?
[02:22] [Garrick]: Yes. L-A-M-B-E-R-T.
[02:27] [Receptionist]: Hmm. Do you have a first name? Maybe they changed their last name? 'Cause I'm not able to find...
[02:42] [Garrick]: Uh, it was a gentleman. I'm not sure if they said Lambert or Limbert.
[02:50] [Receptionist]: Now, we do have, uh, we have a Landon Knotts.
[02:57] [Garrick]: Oh, no.
[02:59] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[03:00] [Garrick]: Looks like... I don't know. But that's... it's okay.
[03:04] [Receptionist]: Okay. I don't have Lambert's email. I'm not sure if he works here. I'm still a bit new, um, so maybe he was a previous client or maybe I just don't have his email. Um, but yeah, I can, uh, get this over to the team and have them get back with you as soon as they're able, okay?
[03:18] [Garrick]: Okay, no problem.
[03:21] [Receptionist]: All right. Well, thanks for calling and have a good rest of your day.
