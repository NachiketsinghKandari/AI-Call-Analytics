[00:12] [Receptionist]: Hello, thank you for calling McCrae Law Group. How can we help you?
[00:16] [Dennis Fincher]: Yes, this is Dennis Fincher and I was hurt at on my job about a month ago around the New Years.
[00:26] [Receptionist]: Mhm.
[00:27] [Dennis Fincher]: And so I'm just getting things together. I'm working through a temporary place agency and I just called them to let them know that I was hurt on the job that they've had me placed at. But now I really don't know what to do. And I called my doctor, I went to the doctor, now it's one of them small clinics, she's not actually a doctor doctor, she's like a nurse. So I don't know if they're giving me the runaround saying she's faxing over some papers so I can fill out the workman's comp paperwork, I don't know. So I'm needing some legal advice. Do y'all handle workman's comp?
[01:22] [Receptionist]: Uh, well we focus on personal injury that can include on the job injuries. I myself as a receptionist don't qualify or disqualify anything as long as it's, you know, within our practice areas, which it is. I can gather your information and see about setting up a consultation. It is a free initial consultation.
[01:38] [Dennis Fincher]: Okay, great. Wonderful.
