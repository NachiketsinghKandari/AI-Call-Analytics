[00:14] [Edith Jarnigan]: Uh, good afternoon, sir. Um, I have a question for you. My name is Edith Jarnigan and I live in Harlingen, Texas. I have a grandson that goes to school and he takes the school bus. Well, he was taking the school bus. And one day, out of the blue, he came back and he didn't have his phone, his telephone with him. So what happened is in the way back from school, in the ride back, there was a three or four kids that they were bullying him. They took the phone, broke it, and never returned it back to him. And all this was for one hour. They were bullying him. And the bus driver never turned around, never helped, and even though when my grandson was trying to to get help, the driver ignored him. The situation here is is delicate because the bus driver didn't have doesn't have any training and on the top of it, the the person who's driving this bus doesn't speak English. So there's no way for this kid, this woman to help anybody, you know, even though he was asking for help.
[01:43] [Receptionist]: Okay. I would like to collect some basic information. Our legal team would be able to review this and confirm how we can help. So I just need to collect a few more specifics. Um, can you provide me with the correct spelling for your last name, please?
