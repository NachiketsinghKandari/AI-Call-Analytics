----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded.
[00:05] [Receptionist]: McCraw Law Group, this is Jessica, how may I help you?
[00:08] [James Taylor]: Yes. I'm calling, uh, to see if somebody would take my case. I'm in emergency room right now. I, uh, was going, I live apartment complex and I came out the building to go to my car...
[00:29] [Receptionist]: Mhm.
[00:30] [James Taylor]: ...and I slipped on the ice. Okay. Hit my head and my back and I'm in emergency room.
[00:41] [Receptionist]: Okay. Yes, sir. What I can go ahead and do is start off by getting some initial contact information from you, then you can give me a bit more information on the incident, um, then I can have an attorney review and let you know if this is something that we could help you out with, sir. Mhm. Can I get your first and last name?
[00:57] [James Taylor]: James Taylor.
[01:01] [Receptionist]: James Taylor. Okay. And is this a good callback number in case we get disconnected?
[01:06] [James Taylor]: Yes.
[01:08] [Receptionist]: All right, perfect. Okay. Let me see here. And then how'd you hear about us, sir?
[01:16] [James Taylor]: On the internet.
[01:19] [Receptionist]: On the internet. All right. Just on Google?
[01:23] [James Taylor]: Yes. Oh boy.
[01:27] [Receptionist]: And then I know you said you slipped and fell—
[01:29] [James Taylor]: They just gave me— James Taylor, they they just gave me some morphine, so... I hope I don't fall asleep on you. I'm in pain.
[01:41] [Receptionist]: Yeah, no problem. If it does happen, I can definitely give you a call back at a later time.
[01:45] [James Taylor]: Okay. Okay. Oh wee.
[01:50] [Receptionist]: All right, let me see here. I know you said you slipped and fell at your apartment. Was this in the parking lot?
[01:56] [James Taylor]: No. Well, off of the sidewalk going to the parking lot.
[02:04] [Receptionist]: Sidewalk going to the parking lot. All right. And when did this happen? Was this today?
[02:12] [James Taylor]: Yes. About an hour and a half ago. I'm in emergency room now. Oh boy.
[02:22] [Receptionist]: Okay. And where's your apartment located? Which city, sir?
[02:26] [James Taylor]: Plano, Texas.
[02:29] [Receptionist]: Plano. Mhm. Okay. And then I know you said you're currently in the ER. Did you need to be transported?
[02:38] [James Taylor]: Yes. Uh, I couldn't get up. I had to call the ambulance.
[02:44] [Receptionist]: Mhm. And which ER are you at?
[02:47] [James Taylor]: Methodist in Richardson. It's on Renner— Renner Road. Hmm.
[02:57] [Receptionist]: All right. What I can go ahead and do for you, sir, is place you on a brief hold. I will have one of our attorneys review these details that way I can let you know if this is something that we can move forward with. Mhm. One moment.

[03:03] [ ... Silence (8s) ... ]

[03:11] [Receptionist]: I apologize for that hold there. Are you there, James?
[03:14] [James Taylor]: Yes. Oh boy.
[03:17] [Receptionist]: Yes. So I was able to have our attorneys review these details you provided me and he did want me to let you know that unfortunately this is not something that we could help you out with, sir, um, due to, um, the natural, um, conditions, uh, that caused your slip and fall.
[03:37] [James Taylor]: Natural conditions? What do you mean by that?
[03:41] [Receptionist]: Unfortunately, since, um, the ice, um, on the sidewalk was a natural condition, um, it's not something that we could assist you with. However, if you were still interested in seeking legal assistance for this matter, I could provide you the phone number to the Dallas Bar Association. They're a free referral service that way you could potentially get a second opinion, um, or they could just listen to your case, provide you a list of attorneys, um, that you could definitely reach out to see if they would be, um, able to assist you with this.
[04:14] [James Taylor]: Okay. So are you saying that... uh, I mean... the the the complex is not liable for not... uh... uh... having the sidewalk cleared? That's what you're saying?
[04:31] [Receptionist]: Mhm. Just in the state of Texas, premises liability cases like these are very difficult, um, for, you know, um, attorneys to, um, prove liability on these apartment complexes just because the state of Texas is very strict. Um, so with the the snow and ice being a natural-formed condition, mhm, unfortunately it would be difficult to prove the apartment liable for this incident.
[05:01] [James Taylor]: So, ma'am, ma'am, are you saying that they're not liable to keep the grounds clear, especially after an ice storm? That's what you're saying? In the state of Texas?
[05:13] [Receptionist]: Um, I am not saying that they are not liable. It is, um, just difficult to prove them liable for this incident. Um, so again, not saying that you don't have a case and we do highly encourage you to reach out, um, to, you know, other attorneys for the matter.
