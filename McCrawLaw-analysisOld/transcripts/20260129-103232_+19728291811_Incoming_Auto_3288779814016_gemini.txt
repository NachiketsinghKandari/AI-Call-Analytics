[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Esperanza speaking, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Christina]: Hey, my name is Christina. I am calling, um, it looks like your attorney may be a contingency attorney for a possible couple of cases I'm looking to file. Is that true?
[00:23] [Receptionist]: I'm sorry, um, the call did cut out a little bit. Um, what was the question that you were asking? I did get your first name.
[00:29] [Christina]: Thanks. If, um, if any of your attorneys were contingency attorneys in regards to a couple of cases I'm looking to file.
[00:41] [Receptionist]: Oh, yes, yes, we do work on a contingency, our attorneys.
[00:45] [Christina]: Contingency. Okay. One, oh girl, my life right now is a hot mess.
[00:51] [Receptionist]: That's perfectly okay.
[00:53] [Christina]: Yeah. One is going to be, well, it first starts off with identity theft. And I, I do have insurance in regards to that, that case.
[01:04] [Receptionist]: Mm-hmm.
[01:05] [Christina]: So it would definitely, it would definitely be a contingency what I'm filing with the insurance company.
[01:11] [Receptionist]: Gotcha. Okay. I can definitely get you connected over to an intake specialist and then they would be able to go over—
[01:18] [Christina]: Okay, that would be great. But I did, I didn't know what type of attorneys you are. I'm looking at a contingency case with identity theft and insurance, well, it's identity theft and hacking. So it'd be that case as well as possibly a civil and federal, but we would first have to dig, start digging into the insurance case and then possibly network outward. Do your attorneys do that?
[01:44] [Receptionist]: Um, I'm going to connect you over to an intake specialist and then they'll give you the full, like, in-depth of what they can—
[01:51] [Christina]: Okay. That, that would be wonderful. Thank you so very much. Thank you, thank you.
[01:56] [Receptionist]: Of course. Let me get you connected. Give me one moment, please.
[01:59] [Christina]: Thanks. Thank you.
