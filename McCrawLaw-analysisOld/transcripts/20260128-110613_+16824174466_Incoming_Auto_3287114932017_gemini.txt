[00:00] [Speaker 1]: This call is being recorded. This call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes.
[00:11] [Receptionist]: Hello, thank you for calling McCall Law Group, how can I help you?
[00:16] [Tavon Farrell]: Hello, my name is Tavon Farrell, uh, I have a case with y'all. I believe my representative is Emily and I remember last time I talked to someone, I believe there was two more lawyers on my case, I forgot his name. Uh, I was just wanting to get an update on my case.
[00:32] [Receptionist]: Okay, I can definitely see if I can assist you with this. Um, and just to confirm the best contact number for you, is that the phone number that ends in 4466?
[00:41] [Tavon Farrell]: Yes ma'am.
[00:43] [Receptionist]: All righty. And you said typically you speak with Emily?
[00:46] [Tavon Farrell]: Yes ma'am, I've been speaking to Emily, I believe maybe two weeks ago I had got a new lawyer, uh, I forgot his name, I hate that I forgot his name. Um, but yeah, he's— he's supposedly working on my case as far as, you know, giving me updates. He told me to give him a call if I have any questions. Uh, I'm like his point of contact. But I know Emily was the representative that I was talking to, uh, for a good while. I don't know if she's off my case or— or they just put another representative on my case or added two more, uh, lawyers to my case.
[01:26] [Receptionist]: Okay, got it. All right, well let me see if I can get you some assistance.
[ ... Silence (11s) ... ]
[01:43] [Receptionist]: All righty. All righty, sir, so I do apologize, at this time I do not have anyone that's available, but I will forward this over to Emily and the staff and see if we can have someone follow up with you as soon as possible.
[01:58] [Tavon Farrell]: Yes ma'am, thank you so much.
[02:01] [Receptionist]: Absolutely, thank you for calling. You have a great day now.
[02:04] [Tavon Farrell]: All right, you too.
[02:05] [Receptionist]: Thank you, bye-bye.
