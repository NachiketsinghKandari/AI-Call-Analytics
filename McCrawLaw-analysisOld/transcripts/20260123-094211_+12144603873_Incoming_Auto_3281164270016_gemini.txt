[00:00] [Unknown]: This call is being recorded.
[00:04] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Marisa, how can I help you?
[00:08] [Esteban]: Yes ma'am, um, this is Esteban. Actually, it's kind of late, but anyways, I had a missed call from like last time I had talked to the staff. I think it was like maybe two days later and it's been a while, but I I was just going through right now and I thought I'd look at them and I went like, "Oh, kind of wonder if you needed anything from me."
[00:39] [Receptionist]: Oh, I see. Okay, uh, would you mind just holding on the line for me please and I will connect you over to your case manager? Thank you.
[00:46] [Esteban]: No problem. Mm-hmm.
