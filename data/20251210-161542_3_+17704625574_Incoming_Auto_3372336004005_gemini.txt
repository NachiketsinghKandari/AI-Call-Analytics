[01:52] [ ... Silence (16s) ... ]
[02:08] [Receptionist]: Um, give me one moment, please. Okay, so thank you so much for holding. So the only case that I see for this client, I don't see any like she went to that hospital or that was added to to the case, like Emory.
[02:33] [Nekita]: Okay. Hmm.
[02:35] [Receptionist]: So yeah, I don't see that. Based on the notes and everything, I just see that she went to Magnolia Medical Clinic, but I don't see any Emory. Yeah.
[02:49] [Nekita]: Magnolia? Well, this is North— it's the doctors, Northside Physicians is what I have. Was it on this date of service? Because I'll have to reach back out to it to see, because this is what I have.
[02:59] [Receptionist]: What is— what was the amount that you're looking for?
[03:03] [Nekita]: I have three bills totaling up to 3,577. So I have a bill for, uh, 1,457, a bill for another bill for 1,457, one bill for 663.
[03:18] [Receptionist]: And what is the total amount of that?
[03:21] [Nekita]: 3,577.
[03:26] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I don't see those amounts either here in the, um, in the file.
[03:35] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[03:41] [Nekita]: So you all don't represent her for these dates or for this physician's bill?
[03:46] [Receptionist]: And actually that, um, the accident date that I have is October 24th of '23. So maybe she has another case that we were not, um, aware of or she has maybe—
[04:03] [Nekita]: So I'll reach out to her.
[04:05] [Receptionist]: Yeah, maybe she has another representation for that, but the only accident is from October 24th of '23 and I don't see that bill.
[04:13] [Nekita]: Okay. So I'll reach out to her and let her know. Thank you.
[04:16] [Receptionist]: Okay. Thank you. Have a great day.
[04:18] [Nekita]: You too.
