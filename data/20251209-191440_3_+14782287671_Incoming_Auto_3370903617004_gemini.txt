[00:25] [Carissa Ferrero]: Um, so, this is, this is not, there's not a case in, um, there's not a case yet. I'm trying to build one but I need a lawyer and I'm not sure which attorney to talk to. Anyone is fine because I'm not familiar with your company.
[00:42] [Receptionist]: Um, but is there an injury involved or...
[00:44] [Carissa Ferrero]: Yes ma'am, from a car accident.
[00:47] [Receptionist]: From a car accident? In that case, if you have a car accident, would you like to proceed with an intake process and then after you can speak to the attorney? Or you want to speak to the attorney first?
[01:01] [Carissa Ferrero]: I already went through— so, um, I'm going through the process and unfortunately the police didn't deem anyone at fault, um, so the other person's insurance is giving me a hard time. Um, I have pictures and evidence to provide but before I provide that to the company, I would want to speak to a lawyer to see the best way to go about it.
[01:24] [Receptionist]: Understood. Would you please bear with me? I don't have an attorney at the moment as they work until 5:00 PM, but allow me one moment, let me speak to my supervisor and see at what time would be in and if we can schedule a call for you with an attorney. One moment, please.
