[00:58] [Receptionist]: Yes sir, that's right. So Mr. uh let me see here, Mr. Alfonso Key. So looking at this, you should be receiving a call from Lillian. However, I'm gonna go ahead and connect the call over to Lillian because Mr. Ford is no longer with Bain Associates unfortunately.
[01:19] [Mr. Alfonso]: And that's and that's the thing I was talking to him about, he said he was going because I've been switched over to so many different lawyers and then you know it ends up like that for the last few years and I don't understand. But during this time when he had it everything was going through litigations and you know they had then got the letters finally sent out, the person answered back, you know uh I was waiting I supposed to have a thing back where the response from them months ago. So I don't understand.
[01:57] [Receptionist]: So yeah, what happens is it has happened right now recently that we have had some changes in the office but we are working on that to you know make sure everyone is assisted correctly. Now I know for a fact uh Mr. Key that your case basically is in litigation discovery. So right now that is the period of time where everything is gathered and make sure it's reviewed before before going to court.

She's been working on this and getting everything you know in motion uh for you. Uh however Lillian is out today. She's gonna be out if I'm not mistaken from the third until the seventh. So this week Lillian is out. She is possibly in court this week. However I can leave a message for her Mr. Key and have her reach out to you as quick as possible uh to provide you with an update you know regarding this case and how everything is going.
