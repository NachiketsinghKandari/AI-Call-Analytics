----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates Law Firm, my name is Fatima. How may I assist you?
[00:09] [Jaris Walker]: Hey yes, I got a quick question. I want to make sure that the person that called me was a legit person. Um, they had called me about my accident but I want to know um, I just got questioned, I just wanted to know where did they like who referred me to them and all. That's all I want to know.
[00:26] [Receptionist]: Oh, absolutely. May I please have your first and last name?
[00:29] [Jaris Walker]: Jaris Walker, J-A-R-I-S W-A-L-K-E-R.
[00:33] [Receptionist]: Thank you for returning the call. We are you were referred to us by the Hurt 911. The accident I have on the email was on the 27th, so this past Monday.
[00:45] [Jaris Walker]: Okay, so how did they get in contact with me though? Like, 'cause somebody called me earlier and just told me that who they was, but who referred me? Like, how did they, you know, actually get in contact with me to yeah.
[00:58] [Receptionist]: The Hurt 911 was the one that sent us the email.
[01:05] [Jaris Walker]: So, okay, so how did Hurt 911 get the email to okay. Okay. I just want to know from...
[01:12] [Receptionist]: ...your treatment. It says here that you're going to the treatment, bear with me, let me open this email once again.
[01:27] [Jaris Walker]: And another thing, who is Hurt 911?
[01:33] [Receptionist]: It's a company.
[01:36] [Jaris Walker]: Yes.
[01:38] [Receptionist]: It says that you're scheduled for a treatment on the 3rd of November at 10:00 AM.
[01:44] [Jaris Walker]: Yes ma'am. Okay, so Hurt 911, okay, so let me get this right 'cause I want to make sure I'm saying it right and doing it right so that I won't think that it's like a scam. So this not a scam, right?
[01:56] [Receptionist]: It is not. We are Bey and Associates Law Firm. So this is the firm. They are the Hurt 911 takes care of the treatment and when a patient goes to them and they don't have an attorney, they would actually send you to us. They will refer you to us because you need representation in order for the attorney to cover your medical bills through the insurance. 'Cause otherwise you'll have some conflict with them 'cause they will try to leave the bill to you and not cover you.
[02:31] [Jaris Walker]: Okay. So quick question. So what I what I'm trying to ask is, so the other person insurance, well the other person when with their um with their insurance and all, they didn't refer me to y'all? Like how they not under y'all or something like that? Or that's why I'm...
[02:47] [Receptionist]: No, 'cause we are only able to represent you. We are not able to represent the person that was at fault. We are only representing you in this matter only if you're not at fault. If on the police report it comes up that you are at fault, the attorneys will drop the case. 'Cause we are not able to represent someone that was at fault. You'll be decided and you would have to deal with some things that an attorney is not going to actually represent you for that.
[03:30] [Jaris Walker]: Okay.
[03:31] [Jaris Walker]: So another question, one more last question that I got. I just want to make sure. So when I had the accident and everything like that, uh was it like a so I just want to know how did they actually get in contact with me? Like what made them like is it was it like a I can't really like explain it how I want to explain it. Like was it like a did they look up a police report? Like what like what really like how did they actually get in...
[03:49] [Receptionist]: Oh, how did the Hurt 911 get in contact with you? That is something that we are not aware of 'cause the attorney doesn't let us know that info. But I have here that Optimum Health, they are asking us if we can kindly um confirm that you're scheduled at the Douglas location, Douglasville location. So their information is not on our system, so we are not, at least not me that the intake department that you are speaking with, does not know that information how do they contact you. As far as we know, we believe that you guys go to get treatment and then you guys get in contact with them, not the other way around.
[04:39] [Jaris Walker]: Oh, I that I don't know. That's not what happened. I didn't even go get treatment or nothing. I just um all I know I filed so what happened was, so I didn't go get treatment or nothing. All I did was file a claim through his insurance. And all I know today that's when somebody called...
[04:57] [Receptionist]: Most likely through the insurance claim then, yeah.
[05:00] [Jaris Walker]: So you think...
[05:02] [Receptionist]: Pardon?
[05:04] [Jaris Walker]: You said you think the insurance claim like when I filed the insurance claim?
[05:07] [Receptionist]: I beg your pardon, Mr. Walker?
[05:10] [Jaris Walker]: So you think the insurance claim when I filed the insurance claim, you think that had really like, you know, brought it to attention or something? Is is that how that go? 'Cause I'm I'm new to this, so I'm trying to make sure I'm, you know, going the right path with it.
[05:27] [Receptionist]: Right. So if you were only in contact with the insurance through the claim, they would most likely be aware of it through some system. I can't really let you know where did they got your info from because I really do not know.
[05:44] [Receptionist]: Yeah. As far as we thought you guys got in contact with them for treatment and because you guys did not have an attorney, they would refer you to us because you do need representation for um for them to be able to actually get you to treatment just because they need to make sure that the attorney is going to take care of the treatment billing part.
[06:21] [Jaris Walker]: Yes ma'am. I understand. I just uh all I say is I don't know. I mean as long as it's legit and it's real, I'm okay with it. I just...
[06:31] [Receptionist]: I mean, are you able to put me on speaker? If I'm not on speaker, you can look it up. You can Google Bey and Associates. And Bey is B as in Bravo, E as in Echo, Y as in Yellow. Bey and Associates Law Firm and you will find it.
[06:51] [Jaris Walker]: Okay, yes ma'am. 'Cause I just the only reason why I called I just wanted to see how did I get contact like got in contact with. That's all I wanted to see.
[07:01] [Receptionist]: I was I actually I was just about to call you because they sent me this info so I was going to get in touch with you to see if you have the time to proceed with the intake um so we can get you assigned to an attorney and a case manager. So would you like to continue with the call for that or do you want to do some research first?
[07:18] [Jaris Walker]: Uh, if y'all you said y'all legit then I mean I go with it. I just...
[07:24] [Receptionist]: Absolutely. I mean you can Google us. We are Bey and Associates and we have an address and everything here in Atlanta. I can give you the address right now. I mean you can go on our website and you'll see you will see the attorneys, you will see the case managers, like everybody is right on the webpage.
[07:41] [Jaris Walker]: Yes ma'am. It's not no I it ain't that I don't think it's like real no. It was just that it was confusing because a number called me just earlier but I didn't know exactly when they told me that they was Bey and Associate, I didn't know like you know too much about it because I was just lost. And then when I asked um when I was trying to figure out like you know exactly how did everybody like you know how they getting in contact with me or how is they you know basically like letting me well typically like knowing that I was in an accident if I didn't go get treatment done, I didn't go do nothing, all I did was file a insurance claim through the other person. That's the only reason why I called to ask. But if y'all legit and everything like that then I go with it. I just...
[08:29] [Receptionist]: Yeah, for sure. I mean we even they sent us the email, they sent us the contract, they give you a 28% on your contract um which is signed by you and I also have the police report and it says here that the state patrol was the one that showed up at the scene. Is that correct?

[15:28] [Receptionist]: Blue Cross Blue Shield, yeah. Okay. So these are all the questions that we have so far. The intake has been completed. I am going to be creating your file based with this information. Once I'm finished, I will be sending you a another HIPAA. On this HIPAA you are going to need to add your social security number so that the attorney can request your medical records. Otherwise um they won't release them to the attorney, okay?
[15:55] [Jaris Walker]: Okay.
[15:56] [Jaris Walker]: And you said who do I got to give my social to?
[15:58] [Receptionist]: No. The HIPAA. You have to add it. After you sign it, it it's going to ask for because the one that they sent us only has your name and your signature but it doesn't have your um social security. And with that we cannot request your medical records. It is added um patient social security number because it is needed. The hospital or any treating facility will not give that to the attorney unless at least the last four has to be added.
[16:31] [Jaris Walker]: Okay.
[16:32] [Receptionist]: Okay. Since you already have our office number and I will be sending you a message that uh will have all of my direct line information as well as the office info. The number that I will be texting you from will belong to your file so anything that you reply to that text number will go directly to your file. Your case manager and the attorney will be able to see anything that you send through that text message as well, okay?
[17:06] [Jaris Walker]: Okay, yes ma'am.
[17:07] [Receptionist]: All right, so if you do have any questions or any concerns, we are going to be here until 8:00 PM tonight, okay?
[17:12] [Jaris Walker]: Okay, yes ma'am.
[17:13] [Receptionist]: All right, so um do you have any other questions for me?
[17:16] [Jaris Walker]: No ma'am, that's it for me.
