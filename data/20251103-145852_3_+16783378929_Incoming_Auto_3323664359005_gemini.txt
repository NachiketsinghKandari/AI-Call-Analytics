[00:13] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, Oaks. I believe it's Jacqueline or...
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We don't have a Jackie.
[00:21] [Joe]: Okay. Well, uh, this is Joe with Spine Muscle and Joint. Um, looking for some policy limits, uh, looks like on a few patients that, um, are on my spreadsheet and I'm looking to see if, uh, let me see if, let me see how many I have. Hold on just a sec.
[00:43] [Receptionist]: Yes, sir.
[00:44] [Joe]: 'Cause I know there's a few of them here, but I've got a few different case managers.
[00:48] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[00:49] [Joe]: Uh, so this first one here is, uh, let me see here. Patient's name is Thalia, T-H-A-L-I-A, last name is Sheffield. And looking for policy limits on her.
[01:05] [Receptionist]: We don't have a Thalia here.
[01:11] [Joe]: You don't have a Thalia Sheffield?

[01:21] [Receptionist]: [ ... Silence (9s) ... ] No, sir. We don't have a Thalia. We have a Tam- Tamiki, a Xavier, a Takisha...
[01:31] [Joe]: Oh boy. Okay. All right. Well, uh, okay. So let me do some checking on that one. Uh, looks like the next patient on this, uh, let me see. This is for Jasper Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.
[01:51] [Receptionist]: Okay. Date of loss?

[02:27] [Joe]: I've got a date of birth of 1/25/90 as well.
[02:30] [Receptionist]: [ ... Silence (27s) ... ] This is so weird. So the one we have has 1- 1- 5- 91. And then her date of loss is 9/12/2025. Let me see if there's maybe a duplicate.
