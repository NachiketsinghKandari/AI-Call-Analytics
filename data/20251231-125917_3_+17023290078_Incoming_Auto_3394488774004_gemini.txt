[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Emma. How can I help you?
[00:05] [Noah]: Hello, this is Noah. I'm calling on behalf of Medicare Recovery Solutions. I hope you are doing good today.
[00:12] [Receptionist]: I'm doing well, thanks. How can I assist you today?
[00:16] [Noah]: I'm just following up regarding two of my clients. I see the case status of the case is settled now and it's in pending reductions. So as we are taking care for the reductions of these clients for in-network providers, so I want the case manager to send over these reductions to us so that we can work on that as it is settled now and we do get this sorted and the reduction done within a week or something.
[00:43] [Receptionist]: Sure, I can help with that. May I have the names of the clients you're calling about?

[01:22] [Receptionist]: I found the case for Arissa Forge. The case manager handling it is Linda Huff, and the case status is pre-lit closing. Unfortunately, I couldn't locate a case for Mickey Hudson. Could you confirm the spelling or provide additional information such as their date of birth or incident date?
