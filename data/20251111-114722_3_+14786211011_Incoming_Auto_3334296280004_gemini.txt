[00:00] [Jesse]: Hello, this is Jesse from B and Associates. How can I help you?
[00:08] [Andrew]: Hello Jesse, my name is Andrew calling from the Geico claims department on a recorded line. I was giving you a call, we had issued payment on- on a case for settlement but it- payment came back because the address I guess you all had moved and so I'm just calling to confirm the correct address for B and Associates.
[00:27] [Jesse]: B and Associates, alright. Give me one moment. Let me confirm with you, um, alright, this is what I'm gonna do. Uh, do you allow me to place you on a brief hold for one minute? Let me just confirm that the main office is the same address, uh, for payments. Is that okay?
[00:42] [Andrew]: Okay, thank you.
