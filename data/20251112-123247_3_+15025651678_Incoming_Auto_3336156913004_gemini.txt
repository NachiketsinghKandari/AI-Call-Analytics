----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bader and Scott, this is Gavin speaking.
[00:06] [Anthony]: Yes, hello Gavin, this is Anthony. I'm calling with the Rollins Company on behalf of Oscar Health here on a recorded and transcribed line. How are you today?
[00:13] [Receptionist]: I'm doing great, great. How about yourself?
[00:16] [Anthony]: I'm doing well, thank you for asking Gavin. Uh, it's going to be for the, uh, Stacia Holleman case.
[00:24] [Receptionist]: Let me pull that up. [ ... Silence (15s) ... ] Can you spell that last name for me, just to make sure I have it correct?
[00:46] [Anthony]: Uh, yes. H-O-L-L-E-M-A-N.
[00:52] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[00:59] [Receptionist]: And you said you were calling in regards to State Farm?
[01:05] [Anthony]: Uh, no. I'm calling with the Rollins Company on behalf of Oscar Health, so on behalf of their health plan. I was trying to reach Michael.
[01:13] [Receptionist]: Oscar Health. Okay.
[01:16] [ ... Silence (5s) ... ]
[01:22] [Receptionist]: So Michael is not available at the moment. Do you happen to have his email?
[01:27] [Anthony]: Uh, yeah, I do. I just wanted to introduce myself since I'm taking over the file moving forward. Um, wanted to see if there was someone that I would be able to discuss this with, um, based on the correspondence received. I know that you guys are requesting a final lien, uh, so I just needed the last date of treatment related. It looks like they had provided the date of loss or the day after, uh, so I didn't know if it had settled, but the email indicates that it did, and he was trying to get it resolved, so I just needed the settlement details.
[02:00] [Receptionist]: What I can do is get you over to the case manager. She can also provide you that information. Unfortunately, she's on the phone right now with someone. Um, Michael is not available via, um, phone calls, only email. Um, but I can get you over to Stephanie and she can provide you that information, or I can get you over to her voicemail so she can return that call, okay?
[02:25] [Anthony]: Oh, okay. Stephanie's not available either?
[02:27] [Receptionist]: Yeah, she's on a call right now.
[02:29] [Anthony]: Okay. All right. Is it better to just respond to their email? Is that the best way to communicate?
[02:35] [Receptionist]: Yeah, you can, uh, with Michael. At least with Michael, yes. It would be easier through, through email.
[02:45] [Anthony]: Okay. And then just to verify, did your all's address change? I had it as a Peachtree Street, uh, Northeast, but it looks like the email, it's, uh, 4200 Northside Parkway Northwest, Building 9. Is that accurate or...?
[02:57] [Receptionist]: That is correct. That is correct. Our, uh, mailing address has changed. We are now at 4200 Northside Parkway Northwest in Building 9, Atlanta, Georgia 30327.
[03:10] [Anthony]: Okay. And then, uh, Michael's the attorney, right?
[03:15] [Receptionist]: Um, the attorney on that one, let me just see... that would be either Steph- sorry, Taylor or Jonathan.
[03:30] [Anthony]: Okay. Taylor Middleton?
[03:33] [Receptionist]: Yes, sir.
[03:35] [Anthony]: Okay. All right. I will go ahead and... and then Michael is the case manager or just the paralegal handling it?
[03:44] [Receptionist]: Paralegal.
[03:46] [Anthony]: Okay. All right. I will go ahead and get it updated now. I appreciate all your time today, Gavin.
[03:53] [Receptionist]: Thank you. You as well.
[03:55] [Anthony]: Thanks. Bye-bye.
[03:56] [Receptionist]: Bye-bye.
