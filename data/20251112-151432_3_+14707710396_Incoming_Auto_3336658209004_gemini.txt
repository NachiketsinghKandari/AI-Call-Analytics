[00:58] [Jairus Walker]: Yes, I need to talk to her because, um, now I had- I sent my car to the shop, but now that I'm trying to get a rental, they telling me that I gotta pay for, I guess, um, the insurance trying to make me pay for everything and then, um, they- they want to reimburse at the end, but I feel like I shouldn't be able to- I shouldn't have to do that only because it wasn't my fault, so I shouldn't have to come out of pocket for nothing. So I just need to- I need to talk to somebody and, um, see what they can do.
