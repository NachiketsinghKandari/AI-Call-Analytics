## Unknown Checkpoint Decision Logic

Found 70 unknown_checkpoint occurrence(s) with decision_logic:

1. The caller questions the receptionist's specific role ('receptionist or switchboard'). This does not fit identification of the caller or case retrieval, but is a meta-discussion about the firm's staff structure. This represents a missing 'staff_validation' checkpoint.
2. The conversation centers on a security breach inquiry and identity theft concerns. This does not match 'retrieve_case' as no specific record was looked up, nor 'enforce_policy' as it involves factual reassurance rather than firm rules. This represents a missing 'Security Advisory' or 'General Inquiry' checkpoint.
3. The caller provides unsolicited feedback/constructive criticism regarding the firm's IT/notification systems. This does not align with case retrieval, policy enforcement, or scheduling, representing a missing checkpoint for 'administrative_feedback'.
4. This segment involves technical troubleshooting of the audio connection and line quality, which is a missing checkpoint in the library.
5. This segment (00:07 - 00:11) represents a triage or intent discovery phase. The current library lacks a dedicated 'triage' or 'intent_discovery' checkpoint. While 'transfer_call' mentions triage in its function mapping, the intent of that checkpoint (moving the caller) does not apply here. This represents a missing checkpoint in the library.
6. The transcript ends abruptly after the transfer initiation. The mandatory 'terminate_call' checkpoint is missing, representing a truncated transcript or an incomplete interaction flow.
7. This segment involves the caller explaining the reason for the call ('returning a call'), but it does not fit 'identify_caller' (no name/role established) or 'retrieve_case' (no record lookup or eligibility check). It represents a 'Non-Actionable Callback' edge case where the caller denies needing help before any standard workflow can begin.
8. This segment represents a 'Triage/Availability Check' phase. While the instructions suggest mapping triage to 'transfer_call', the success criteria for 'transfer_call' requires a completed transfer. Using an unknown checkpoint surfaces the lack of a dedicated 'triage' or 'check_availability' checkpoint in the library.
9. The receptionist enters an infinite verbal loop/stutter. This does not align with any defined business process phase and represents a one-off edge case or technical failure.
10. The segment involves providing physical directions and navigational assistance. This does not fit 'retrieve_case', 'identify_caller', or 'enforce_policy'. This represents a missing 'general_inquiry' or 'navigational_assistance' checkpoint in the library.
11. This segment involves new client intake and gathering incident details. The existing 'retrieve_case' checkpoint requires a 'record found' for success, which is not applicable to a new client inquiry. This represents a missing 'new_client_intake' checkpoint.
12. The transcript concludes abruptly on a hold. This represents a missing 'terminate_call' checkpoint, which is a mandatory requirement for a complete interaction.
13. This segment involves new client intake. The 'retrieve_case' checkpoint requires 'record found' for success, which is impossible for a new client. This represents a missing 'new_client_intake' checkpoint in the library.
14. This segment involves the provision of staff contact information (phone and email) as an alternative to a transfer. The current library lacks a 'provide_information' or 'alternative_resolution' checkpoint.
15. The transcript consists of a single turn providing a callback number and a sign-off. It lacks the mandatory 'initiate_contact' phase and any interactive elements required for standard checkpoints. This represents a one-off edge case, such as a voicemail greeting or a truncated recording, rather than a missing business process checkpoint.
16. The segment involves the provision of a staff member's email address. This does not fit 'retrieve_case' (no case record or eligibility was validated), 'execute_update' (no data was saved to a system), or 'enforce_policy'. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'General Inquiry' or 'Information Provision'.
17. The 'terminate_call' checkpoint is a mandatory requirement but is absent from the transcript, indicating a missing phase or an incomplete recording.
18. The transcript is a fragment of an automated recording that starts mid-sentence. It does not meet the criteria for 'initiate_contact' as there is no formal greeting or professional presence established, and it does not fit any other defined checkpoint. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'automated_notification' or 'outbound_solicitation'.
19. The segment involves a directory lookup for an employee's contact information. This does not fit 'retrieve_case' because no client case or legal record was accessed, and 'identify_caller' was not performed. This represents a missing 'directory_assistance' or 'information_request' checkpoint.
20. This segment involves a B2B service inquiry/pitch regarding lead generation. It does not involve retrieving a specific legal case record (retrieve_case) nor does it fit other defined checkpoints. This represents a missing 'Business Development/Vendor Inquiry' checkpoint.
21. The receptionist provides a direct phone number for a manager. This is not a 'transfer_call' (the call remains with the receptionist) nor a 'schedule_followup' (no appointment is made). This represents a missing 'Information Referral' checkpoint.
22. This segment involves a request for a specific staff member ('Paige') and a triage response. This represents a routing or triage phase which is not explicitly defined in the checkpoint library. Additionally, the 'identify_caller' checkpoint was skipped entirely as the agent did not ask for the caller's name.
23. This segment involves the receptionist identifying the assigned staff and providing their specific contact information. This is a distinct phase of information provision that is not covered by the existing checkpoint library (which focuses on retrieval, updates, or transfers).
24. This segment involves defining the data requirements (Name, DOB, DOI) for a future bulk lookup. It is marked as 'unknown_checkpoint' because it represents a 'Requirement Definition' phase. It does not fit 'retrieve_case' because no specific record was searched for or found during the call, and it is distinct from 'enforce_policy' as it pertains to data attributes rather than procedural rules.
25. The interaction involves verifying a general company email address for bulk submissions. This does not match 'retrieve_case' (no specific record), 'execute_update' (no data saved to a system), or 'enforce_policy'. It represents a missing 'administrative_inquiry' checkpoint.
26. The transcript contains only the repetitive phrase 'Juan J-' without any greeting, identification, or case-related dialogue. It does not meet the criteria for 'initiate_contact' or any other defined checkpoint.
27. The receptionist provides the fax number to the caller. This does not fit 'execute_update' (no data saved), 'enforce_policy' (no rules explained), or 'retrieve_case' (which failed). This represents a missing checkpoint for 'provide_information'.
28. This segment involves a request for internal staff identity. It does not fit 'retrieve_case' as no case record or ticket was accessed, and it does not fit 'enforce_policy' because the refusal was not acknowledged by the caller. This represents a missing 'General Inquiry' or 'Staff Directory' checkpoint.
29. This segment involves the receptionist providing the firm's contact information (email) to the caller. This does not align with 'retrieve_case' (gathering info), 'execute_update' (saving info), or 'enforce_policy' (explaining rules). It represents a missing 'provide_information' or 'resolution' checkpoint.
30. The transcript begins with a case-specific statement from the receptionist ('rear-ended at 15 mph') without a preceding greeting or identification. This represents a one-off edge case of a fragmented or out-of-order recording start.
31. The caller is requesting general office information (fax number). This does not meet the criteria for 'retrieve_case' as no specific record was located, no eligibility was validated, and no case-specific details were captured. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'General Inquiry' or 'Information Provision'.
32. The transcript ends while the caller is on hold. The mandatory 'terminate_call' checkpoint is missing because the conversation was cut off.
33. The conversation shifted to a request for a referral fee. This does not fit 'retrieve_case' or 'enforce_policy' (regarding case law) and represents a missing checkpoint for 'referral_management' or 'financial_incentives'.
34. This segment covers new client intake and appointment scheduling. It does not fit 'retrieve_case' because there is no existing record to locate or eligibility to validate. It does not fit 'schedule_followup' because that is defined for callbacks/messages, not firm appointments. This represents a missing 'new_client_intake' or 'schedule_appointment' checkpoint.
35. The agent places the caller on hold. This represents a missing 'triage' or 'hold' checkpoint in the library. It cannot be classified as 'transfer_call' because no transfer was initiated or completed, and it is distinct from the data-gathering phase of 'retrieve_case'.
36. This segment involves verifying the firm's physical mailing address and the specific roles of various staff members (attorneys vs paralegals). This is administrative data verification and does not fit 'retrieve_case' (which is about the specific legal record) or 'execute_update' (which implies the firm updating its own data). This represents a missing 'Administrative/Firm Inquiry' checkpoint.
37. This segment consists of an extended social exchange regarding career history, mental health, and workload empathy. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'rapport_building' or 'social_exchange'.
38. The transcript contains only a statement of business hours and a brief thank you. It does not meet the success criteria for 'initiate_contact' (no greeting/acknowledgment) or 'terminate_call' (no formal two-way sign-off). This represents a missing checkpoint for 'provide_general_info' or an automated message fragment.
39. This segment involves an internal consultation/availability check and a hold period. This represents a missing checkpoint in the library for 'Internal Triage' or 'Staff Consultation'.
40. This segment involves the receptionist providing specific case data (injuries/treatment) and staff names. It does not fit 'retrieve_case' (which is prior to execution) or 'execute_update' (no data saved). This represents a missing checkpoint for 'Provide Case Information'.
41. This segment involves a general administrative inquiry (requesting a fax number) and a partial identification (role only). It does not fit 'identify_caller' because no name was provided/requested, and it does not fit 'retrieve_case' because no specific record was accessed or validated. This represents a missing 'General Inquiry' or 'Administrative Support' checkpoint.
42. The transcript consists entirely of a single repeated syllable ('Ben-') without a formal greeting or caller acknowledgement. It fails to meet the success criteria for 'initiate_contact' and does not align with any other defined phase. This represents a technical glitch or a stuck audio loop.

44. This segment involves capturing the caller's email address to send firm information. This represents a 'Lead Contact Capture' phase which is not explicitly defined in the library as it is distinct from accident facts (retrieve_case) or arranging a callback (schedule_followup).
45. The receptionist provides the Case Manager's direct contact information. This represents a missing checkpoint in the library (e.g., 'provide_internal_contact') as it is a distinct phase of information sharing that does not involve looking up a case or enforcing policy.
46. The interaction involves providing routing information for a misdirected call. This does not match 'retrieve_case' (no case exists), 'transfer_call' (no transfer was initiated), or 'enforce_policy'. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'Routing Assistance' or 'Internal Redirection'.
47. This segment involves the caller stating their intent and a grievance (lack of communication on a case). This does not fit 'identify_caller' as no name was provided, nor 'retrieve_case' as no lookup or validation was performed. This represents a missing 'state_intent' or 'complaint_handling' checkpoint in the library.
48. This segment involves resolving technical audio issues and providing firm-level administrative data (Tax ID and staff email). This represents a missing checkpoint for 'Administrative Information Sharing' or 'Firm Data Provision'.
49. This segment involves the caller clarifying the agent's name (Devin) which does not fall under case retrieval, identification, or policy enforcement. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'Staff Identification' or 'Rapport'.
50. The caller requests the agent's name for their records. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'Agent Identification' or 'Verification' as it does not pertain to identifying the caller or retrieving a case.

53. The caller began asking for personal social media and dating app information (Grinder, Tinder). This is an edge case involving inappropriate behavior that does not map to business process checkpoints.
54. The caller requests the receptionist's name and spelling at the end of the call. This represents a missing checkpoint for 'Staff Identification' or 'Administrative Wrap-up' that does not fit the intent of identifying the caller or retrieving a case.
55. The conversation shifted to B2B sales discovery regarding the firm's internal payroll software and employee count. This does not match case retrieval, policy enforcement, or routing, representing a missing checkpoint for 'Sales Discovery' or 'Firm Demographics'.
56. This segment involves extensive rapport building, empathy, and personal encouragement which does not fit the strict logic of case retrieval or policy enforcement. It represents a missing 'rapport_building' or 'customer_service' checkpoint.
57. This segment involves gathering details for a new client intake. The 'retrieve_case' checkpoint requires a 'record found' status for success, which is logically impossible for a new lead. This represents a missing 'new_client_intake' or 'lead_capture' checkpoint in the library.
58. The caller asks for general contact information (email address) for future updates. This represents a missing checkpoint for general customer service or procedural inquiries that do not involve specific case retrieval or policy enforcement.

This represents a missing 'provide_information' or 'alternative_resolution' checkpoint.
64. This segment involves redirecting a new lead to an alternative intake method (email). It does not fit 'retrieve_case' because no record was searched and details were not gathered during the call.
