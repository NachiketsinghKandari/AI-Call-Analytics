[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bay and Associates, this is Devin speaking.
[00:06] [Joanne Kennedy]: Hey, good morning. This is Joanne Kennedy calling from Nationwide Insurance and call may be monitored for quality assurance. I'm looking to speak to Matthew regarding your client Gustav Charles.
[00:19] [Receptionist]: Let me pull this up. Gustav Charles, right?

[01:03] [Receptionist]: Yes. Okay, let me give you... Tyauna's email is her first name, Tyauna, which is spelled T for Tom, Y, A, U, N as in Nancy, A at bayandassociates.com. That is B-E-Y and associates...
[01:36] [Joanne Kennedy]: And is the "and" spelled out or is it the symbol?
[01:42] [Receptionist]: Yes, ma'am. The "and" is spelled out, A-N-D. Associates will be plural, dot com.
[01:49] [Joanne Kennedy]: Perfect. Thank you very much for your help. But you can send me over to her voicemail too, if you can.
