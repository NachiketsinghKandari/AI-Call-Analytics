    *   "Hello?"

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:11.*
    *   "Yes, I was trying to get a hold of Victoria. I just spoke with her. I'm trying to call her back."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:18.*
    *   "Okay, no problem ma'am. Let me go ahead and reach out for her, okay? May I have your first and last name please?"

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:23.*
    *   "It's Alicia Emam."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:28.*
    *   "Emam, okay. One brief moment while I get you over to Victoria, okay?"

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:34.*
    *   "Alright, thank you."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:53.*
    *   "Seems like Victoria already left for today."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:56.*
    *   "Oh my goodness. Is there anybody else that can help me?"

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 01:00.*
    *   "Well, I mean, my son went to the bank and he- they won't accept that check that- that Bain and Associates wrote for me. I just need to know what else I need to do. Uh, she did talk with the woman at the bank, so now they're saying they still can't accept that check from Bain and Associates."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 01:20.*
    *   "Okay, I see here, yeah, um, since I think maybe Federal was not accepting it, um, but you were going to try Bank of America. Bank of America did not accept the check?"

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 01:33.*
    *   "I haven't been there. The reason why is because I'm bedbound and my ID is, uh, expired. My bank was going to- they said my, uh, ID there was okay. It was just that the letter- the check didn't look legible. So I don't know if they'll accept my ID, because like I said, it's- it's expired and I can't even get to the DMV office to even get a new ID because I'm in the bed and I can't move. Lord, this is just- it's just... Alright then, well I- even if I can't take it to Bank of America, just have her call me tomorrow so she can let me know what- what else they can do."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 02:18.*
    *   "I will have Victoria call you tomorrow, okay?"
    *   "Uh-huh."
    *   "So she can help you sort it out. No problem, ma'am."
    *   "Alright."
    *   "We'll do everything we can."
    *   "Alright, bye-bye."
    *   "Bye-bye."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:00.*
    *   "Bain and Associates, Dante speaking."
    *   Wait, it's "Bain and Associates, Dante speaking."

    *   *Wait, let me re-listen to 00:06.*
