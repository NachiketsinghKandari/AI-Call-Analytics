[08:42] [Receptionist]: Okay, so tell me what happened that night.
[08:44] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, yes. As we were trick-or-treating with our, um, well, my nieces and nephew, um, it was three, uh, vehicles that was, you know, with us. And after we made a stop, um, at, um, um, you know, getting out and we had our hazards on, um, I noticed a big boom and when the, I was already getting out the car, um, and my sister that was trailing, um, me, um, I noticed that the Ashanti Lewis, um, was hit by another vehicle.
[09:22] [Receptionist]: She was rear-ended? Did the, the impact happen, um, from the back?
[09:30] [Kiana Swinger]: Yes.
[09:32] [ ... Silence (21s) ... ]
[09:54] [Receptionist]: All right. And you haven't consulted with any other attorneys besides us, right?
[09:59] [Kiana Swinger]: No. I, um, I was waiting for the, I guess the attorney that you all that took her case to contact me. I didn't hear anything, um, so I ended up calling myself because my son has just been having, um, pain in certain areas. Um, he does play, um, football, but the football season, but, you know, it's, it's just getting a little worse, like his, his neck and certain areas he's been having pain.
[10:34] [Receptionist]: Okay. And, um, what was the time of the incident?
[10:38] [Kiana Swinger]: I would say around 8:00-ish, 8:00, 8:30, almost about 9:00, basically. Yeah, 9:00, 9:21, around that time.
[10:55] [Receptionist]: Do you know what location it happened?
[10:59] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, in Forest Park. Um, I think, uh, if I'm not mistaken, um, I would say Main Street, but I'm, I'm not too sure of the, uh, street because it was dark.
[11:18] [Receptionist]: Okay. What police department showed up?
[11:21] [Kiana Swinger]: Uh, Forest Park.
[11:27] [Receptionist]: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
[11:29] [Kiana Swinger]: Forest Park. Forest, F-O-R-E-S-T, Park, P-A-R-K.
[11:41] [Receptionist]: Okay, Forest Park. Okay. Do you know if any, um, citations were issued?
[11:45] [Kiana Swinger]: No, I don't at all. I don't know. That's why I'm trying to see, um, after the, I thought the attorney would contact us because, um, my son was in the vehicle with her.
[12:11] [Kiana Swinger]: All the thing I have is my, um, son's discharge papers from the hospital.
[12:17] [Receptionist]: Was he transported in an ambulance?
[12:20] [Kiana Swinger]: No. My sister, um, drove right after the scene. But an ambulance did come to the scene and check her and the other, well, my son as well and also my nephew. My nephew and my son was in the back seat while my sister was driving with my niece in the passenger seat. So they checked everyone in, um, at the ambulance, um, and, um, she, she told me that they, her, her and the daughter, um, blood pressure was high at the scene, but when they went to the hospital, I guess it went down.
[13:10] [Receptionist]: What hospital did they go to?
[13:12] [Kiana Swinger]: Piedmont Fayetteville, um, hospital.
[13:22] [Receptionist]: Piedmont?
[13:24] [Kiana Swinger]: Yes, in Fayetteville.
[13:33] [Receptionist]: Did they do any X-rays or scans?
[13:38] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, I think. I'm not too sure, um, to be honest with you. I would say yes, but, um, I'm not too sure. She has his paperwork, um, but I can get, you know, the paperwork, um, from her.
[14:03] [Receptionist]: Do you have that police report number on hand?
[14:06] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, no. But I can try to receive it if needed. I would thought that the, um, the attorney would contact the owner of the car, which is my mother, and in, and, you know, make sure everything was well with her. But they just contacted my sister, that's why I'm kind of confused right now.
[14:30] [Receptionist]: Um, usually, well, we only have contact with who was involved in the, um, accident and then the insurance, um, they usually call whoever the, the owners are. Um, do you have any pictures of the damages?
[14:48] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, yes, I do. Um, my sister, um, sent them to my phone.
[15:02] [Receptionist]: Was the car towed?
[15:06] [Kiana Swinger]: No.
[15:07] [Receptionist]: What are the injuries that your son received or pain complaints that he's having?
[15:14] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, he received whiplash, I guess from the documents from the hospital. Um, his, his wrist because his hand was leaning on the door. Um, he's, um, having headaches and neck pain, back pain as well. He said when the impact hit on him, he hit the, his head because he didn't have his seatbelt on due to the fact when we stopped, he was getting ready to get out the car. So by the time when, I guess that person hit them, his hand was on the door about to open the door and that's when he hit his head on the, um, seat and his knees and his arms by the door on the impact.
[16:15] [Receptionist]: Okay. What are some things that he is doing that he's having pain?
[16:19] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, he's having pain.
[16:23] [Receptionist]: Like laying, um, lifting, turning his head?
[16:30] [Kiana Swinger]: Yes. Yes. Um, like so, after lifting, uh, lifting, what you feeling?
[16:40] [Ronnie Parrott Jr.]: When I go down on my back. When I'm sitting down for a while, while, my back begins to hurt. While I'm in class and I have to sit, when I stand up straight, it just hurts.
[16:54] [Kiana Swinger]: Well, he's mentioning now that when he sits down for a long period of time, his back hurts, um, in his side, like area, um, to the point where he, he asks his teacher to let him get up and I guess try to walk. He gets Charlie horses in the back, um, around his lower back, um, and headaches. Um, he did not go to school today, um, due to his, um, pain.
[17:31] [Receptionist]: Does he receive Medicaid or Medicare?
[17:36] [Kiana Swinger]: Yes.
[17:40] [Receptionist]: Which one?
[17:41] [Kiana Swinger]: Um, uh, Medicaid, um, through with Amerigroup.
[17:50] [Receptionist]: All right. I'll go ahead, we are all done with the questions here. Um, I'll go ahead and send over the contract and HIPAA. Um, you would have to, you would have to, um, sign for him due to him being a, a minor. It will say, um, I think it's on behalf of, then it would be, um, your name then his name. Let me see.
[18:32] [Receptionist]: Bless you.
[18:34] [Kiana Swinger]: Thank you.
[18:36] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. Okay.
[18:59] [Receptionist]: All right, Miss Swinger, it should come as a text message. Let me know if you received it.
[19:13] [Kiana Swinger]: Bates and Associates LLC is, okay, yes.
[19:26] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[19:33] [Receptionist]: All right. Well, if you have any questions or concerns, um, I can give you a call back later and see. Um, in the meantime, you can go ahead look over the contract. Once you sign, it automatically will return to me, then like I said, I will assign the same case manager as your sister's and then they will be working on the case, both cases, and then they will be following up with treatment and seeing where you're at with everything and letting you know where, where we are in the case.
[20:13] [Kiana Swinger]: Okay, thank you.
[20:14] [Receptionist]: All right, Miss Swinger, you have a great rest of your day.
[20:17] [Kiana Swinger]: You too.
