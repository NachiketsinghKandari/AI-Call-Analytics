I just want to make sure before I send out the email, like is there any information that you require from my side? Because I usually send out the email to the law firms that includes the client name, their first date of injury, that's the first date of accident, and the date of birth. That's the information that I send out usually from my side. So if there's any other information that you might require or you have an idea that Dionel might require?
