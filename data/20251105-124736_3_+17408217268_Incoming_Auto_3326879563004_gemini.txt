[00:00] [Becky]: Bey and Associates Law Firm, this is Becky speaking.
[00:06] [Wayne Slanska]: Uh, yes, my name is Wayne Slanska and uh, I'm trying to get a lady that's been getting a hold of me. Um, shoot. Starts with D-O-R. I can't pronounce her name.
[00:27] [Becky]: Okay, so you're trying to get a hold of your case manager?
[00:31] [Wayne Slanska]: Uh, she was going over my case. She was, uh, they were trying to get a hold of me and every time I call her, um, phone number, it rings one time and then it clicks off. So I didn't know if there's something messed up on my end or what was going on. I left her a text, but I don't know if she was going to see it or not.
[00:58] [Becky]: Okay, let me see what's going on here.
[01:05] [Wayne Slanska]: She was needing my doctor and all kinds of stuff, but I got some of it.
[01:18] [ ... Silence (13s) ... ]
[01:31] [Becky]: One second, let me see who's working the file. Okay.
[01:36] [ ... Silence (3s) ... ]
[01:39] [Becky]: Okay, that would be Natasha. So let me get you over to her, okay?
[01:44] [Wayne Slanska]: Okay.
[01:47] [Becky]: Mr. Slanska, um, Natasha's not available at the moment, but I can get a message over to her and have her reach out to you as soon as possible.
[02:01] [Wayne Slanska]: Okay. Uh, yeah, just tell her that I left her texts, um, the doctor and the hospital's address and phone number, uh, account numbers and what- what I could get a hold of. Because I can't get a hold of her through texts or anything. Or she won't respond, so I figured she was busy. Okay. I appreciate it. I just wanted her to know that I did try to get a hold of her today.
[02:36] [Becky]: Sure. So I'm going to ask her to give you a call, okay?
[02:40] [Wayne Slanska]: Okay. Yes. 2- 2- 2- 3- 7- 0- 2- 3- 0- 1.
[02:44] [Becky]: All right.
[02:45] [Wayne Slanska]: Okay, thank you.
[02:46] [Becky]: You're welcome. Take care.
[02:48] [Wayne Slanska]: You too. Bye-bye.
