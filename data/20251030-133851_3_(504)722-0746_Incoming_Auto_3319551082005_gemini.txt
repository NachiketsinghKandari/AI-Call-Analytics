[01:10] [Speaker 2]: Okay. And are, sorry, I, um, are you a receptionist or switchboard or...
[01:19] [Receptionist]: Receptionist. I actually intake specialist.
[01:22] [Speaker 2]: Oh, okay. Uh, okay, so I am looking for an attorney and the person at Jones Walker, I thought I was, you know, I'm looking for potentially somebody in trust and estate, but she suggested because we're working on a post-nup agreement that I might want to see somebody in family law. So, you know, it's not about a divorce or anything like that, I have a very amicable relationship with my husband and we're just trying to, uh, rectify what we think is an inadequate, uh, pre-nup and, uh, you think that Stephen Lane may be able to help me?
[01:56] [Receptionist]: Um, I'm not sure about that part, uh, because we are in Georgia, but, um, and then he's in our office in, in New Orleans. But, okay, usually we—
[02:13] [Speaker 2]: The, the, the thing that kind of threw me a little bit as I was looking at a magazine and, you know, I got this referral from Jones Walker, but I think I had seen him in my list of attorneys to contact and I tried calling one number and associated with his name under family law, you know, I have no idea like who he is or anything like that, just, you know, he's just a name in a magazine, uh, no picture or anything like that. And it said that they, they had no office, like no working office in New Orleans, but you're saying they do. So, maybe I was like looking at an old number or something. Are you able to transfer me directly to him?
[02:52] [Receptionist]: Yes, ma'am.
[02:55] [Speaker 2]: Okay, that'd be great.
[02:58] [Receptionist]: All right, sending you over. You have a great rest of your day.
[03:01] [Speaker 2]: Okay, you too. Thanks. Bye-bye.
