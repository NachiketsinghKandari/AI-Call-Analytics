[00:02] [Receptionist]: Bain and Associates, Kim speaking?

[00:05] [Candrice Lewis]: Hi, um, my name is Candrice Lewis. I received a certified letter in the mail from you guys, um, in regards to a case, um, for a young lady, um, Kamisha Hutchinson.

[00:21] [Receptionist]: Kamisha Hutchinson. Mm-hmm. Yes, one second.

[00:29] [Receptionist]: Okay, one second, let me see if I can get that pulled up here. Okay.

[00:48] [Receptionist]: Could you spell Kamisha for me?

[00:52] [Candrice Lewis]: Uh, I actually don't have the paperwork with me, it's in the office, um, I ran out to make the call and forgot the paperwork. Um, but I think it's K-A-M-E-S-H-I-A Hutchinson?

[01:01] [Receptionist]: Okay, I got it here. Okay. And you said, and you, and you are calling from where?

[01:19] [Candrice Lewis]: Um, calling from my—what do you mean?

[01:24] [Receptionist]: Oh, like are you—the person that received—I received the certified letter in the mail, um, in regards to this case. I'm calling because I'm confused on why she put my name down even though I am the insurance holder, I wasn't the person that was in the accident.

[01:44] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me, um, let me get the case manager for you. She could be able to, um, check this out. Um, I was asking just in case you were from a—an insurance company, that's why I asked where you were calling from. I'm sorry.

[02:02] [Candrice Lewis]: No worries.

[02:04] [Receptionist]: Let me get her, Ms. Linda Huff is her name. She is on another call right now. Um, let me see if I could direct message her.

[02:13] [ ... Silence (15s) ... ]

[02:29] [Receptionist]: Okay, you said that you received the—the email—I mean the—the certified letter.

[02:40] [ ... Silence (20s) ... ]

[03:01] [Receptionist]: I don't have anything here, but, um, what I can do is, um, because Ms. Linda's on another call right now, I can get your name and number and have her reach out to you and then she'll explain what's going on.

[03:14] [Candrice Lewis]: Okay.

[03:16] [Receptionist]: Okay, can I have your first and last name?

[03:58] [Candrice Lewis]: 4-0-4-5-1-4-9-6-3-7.

[04:05] [Receptionist]: Okay. Seems like my dyslexia is acting up a little bit today. All right, I'll let her know to give you a call as soon as she's off the phone so that she can go ahead and explain why you received this letter.

[04:14] [Candrice Lewis]: Okay, thank you.

[04:17] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. You have a great rest of your day, Ms. Lewis.
