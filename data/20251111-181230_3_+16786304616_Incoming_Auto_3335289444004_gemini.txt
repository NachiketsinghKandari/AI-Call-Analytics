----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Fatima Hamayun]: Anid and Associates Law Firm and my name is Fatima Hamayun, how may I assist you?
[00:08] [Speaker 2]: Hi, yes. I was calling to see if you guys would be able to take, um, over my case. Um, I called a few other law firms and they weren't able to deal with school bus accidents. Um, and I was trying to see if you guys are because I, um, looked up some and it says you- that's one of your specialties.
[00:28] [Fatima Hamayun]: Mhm. So, you- were you injured in this accident?
[00:32] [Speaker 2]: Well, so my daughters was on the school bus and it got in a accident and I- the school did not notify me. They kind of actually covered this whole thing up. I just found out today the accident happened last week. My daughters had been complaining about pain and I really didn't think much of it until I was on the road that the accident happened and my daughter was like, "Mommy, this is where the accident happened." And I was like, "Well, what accident?" And she explained to me, you know, we fell off the- we ran off the road, we hit a, um, mailbox or whatever happened, they hit their heads and stuff. And I called the school and I'm like, "Hey, I haven't heard anything." I spoke with the principal today and she's like, "Oh yeah, it was an accident. We sent out an email." And I'm like, "I didn't get an email." And you- you didn't call me, you know. And she's like, "Oh, well, we- we asked the kids if they were okay and they said they were okay." I said, "Ma'am, you're not in the medical field. How could you make that?" They- so they didn't do a police report. Um, it was actually like a cover-up so the bus driver that did it was a substitute bus driver. She didn't even report it to the school. The reason the school knew was because per the principal, they looked at the bus and it was damaged. And they said, "Why is the bus damaged?" That's when it was brought to their attention and when they started investigating they realized that she had, you know, hit- did all this stuff and just dropped the kids off like nothing happened. Then they said they had to stop her, they couldn't allow her to drive anymore and, you know, supervisors got involved and I- and I'm just learning all this information. She did state that some other kids already went to, you know, get checked out, but my daughters, you know, just experiencing pain for a week and no one told me. Um, I asked them, you know, basically why didn't I get an email or phone call. She's, you know, you know how people are stuck, they don't even know what to say. And then she's like, "Oh, your- your email is blocked." I said, "Ma'am, there's no way my email is blocked. I emailed you before, you're the principal." And she called my email out. I said, "If my email was blocked, you did it." I said, "I didn't get an email and I wasn't notified." You know, so it's very concerning. A lot of things just, you know, don't make sense. I asked for the video footage, said they don't have any video footage.
[02:40] [Fatima Hamayun]: And they didn't file a police report?
[02:42] [Speaker 2]: Oh my god. No. No. She said, "Well, none of the kids were- no one was hurt." I said, "Well, that's not up- for you to determine." So they didn't do- because I guess it hit a mailbox and it didn't hit another car, that's probably why the police didn't get called, so the bus driver probably thought she could get away with it until they recognized it.
[03:00] [Fatima Hamayun]: Right, but they had passengers, so one should have been filed regardless, right? Would you please allow me one more moment? Let me confirm if I have an attorney available that I can consult because there isn't a police report, there isn't another vehicle involved, so I would have to confirm if that- if there is a case that they can file with you, okay? Allow me one moment.
[03:26] [Speaker 2]: Okay.
[03:27] [ ... Silence (5s) ... ]
[03:33] [Fatima Hamayun]: Hi, thank you so much for the waiting time. I apologize for the delay. How long ago was the accident? Do you know the exact date?
[04:06] [Speaker 2]: It was just- it was Wednesday, November 6th, so it's not even a week ago and I'm actually, um...
[04:13] [Fatima Hamayun]: It's almost a week.
[04:15] [Speaker 2]: Yeah. Um, yeah. I was going to try to get a- I don't know how to get a police report, but I definitely was going to ask for it to be done. I know they have incident reports, I know it's, you know, written up and I know it's documented, but, you know...
[04:31] [Fatima Hamayun]: The attorney just actually requested that if you're able to file a complaint with the school or the police and you have a report, then they are going to be able to assist. Because without a report, there isn't, you know, there isn't a case because it'll be just who says this one said that one said. But if you actually have a report because your daughter is unwell, she's not feeling well, she's hurt, and of course after you have that report then you can add the rest of course, emotional damage because they didn't say anything and your daughter's been going through the pain for a whole week without the school notifying you.
[05:17] [Speaker 2]: Correct. Which is- okay, yes. And I actually have two daughters, so it would be two cases. They're- they're both...
[05:22] [Fatima Hamayun]: Two cases. Yeah. Yeah. They're both under age, absolutely. Yeah.
[05:25] [Speaker 2]: Yeah, so I'm going to, um, definitely- no worries, I will be filing a complaint. Like I said, I'm just finding out all the details. I will be filing a complaint with the school, I'm going to write up my email today and I will be calling the, um, local police so they can get involved and see how I get a police report prepared now.
[05:39] [Fatima Hamayun]: Right. As soon as you have a police report or the report from the school, then do please give us a call back so then we can create the file for you.
[05:50] [Speaker 2]: Yes, ma'am. Thank you, I appreciate it so much. Should I call back this number?
[05:56] [Fatima Hamayun]: Absolutely. And we are open from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, so you can give us a call during those hours.
[06:02] [Speaker 2]: Okay, sounds good. Thank you.
[06:05] [Fatima Hamayun]: Okay. All right. You're welcome. Bye-bye.
