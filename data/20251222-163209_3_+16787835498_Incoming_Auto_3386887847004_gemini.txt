[ ... Silence (5s) ... ]
[00:35] [Receptionist]: Yes, I do have a Betty Cynius, but I have a different spelling on the last name. I got C-I-N-E-U-S, is that what you have?
[00:45] [V]: No, let's see, let me pull up the police report one second.

If you like, I can provide you with her email. Uh, I can also transfer you over to her voicemail so you can leave one. Uh, and I'm also going to send her an email so that she can get back to you as soon as possible. And it looks like that she's off for the day today.
