[00:00] [Devin]: Ben Associates Law Firm, Devin speaking.

[00:06] [Brianna Albert]: Hi. Um, I decided to call the Georgia branch because I'm getting no straight answer from my actual lawyer. Um, I was told by the— my lawyer who's act— in Cincinnati, Ohio, um, he said that he set everything up and that he sent everything to you guys to, like, disperse and stuff. But for the past two weeks, he's said I'll have it by the end of the week, and mail has posted today and I still don't have my settlement check, like, my portion of it. And I'm on— like, he won't answer my calls and he's very short with me whenever I ask him what's going on, but it's been a year since the car accident I was in and— and it's still not even finalized. So, I'm a— I'm a little— a little bored of waiting.

[01:07] [Devin]: Okay. I understand, ma'am. So, let me go ahead and pull up your file and see what is going on regarding your disbursement check, okay? May I have your first and last name, please?

[01:20] [Brianna Albert]: Brianna Albert.

[01:22] [Devin]: Brianna Albert. Okay. [ ... Silence (08s) ... ] Okay, this is the motor vehicle accident from November 5th of last year.

[01:36] [Brianna Albert]: Yeah.

[01:37] [Devin]: All right. I'm going to put you on a brief hold, okay?

[01:41] [Brianna Albert]: Okay.

[01:42] [Devin]: Thank you.

[01:47] [Devin]: Miss Albert, I do apologize for that delay. I'm still trying to communicate with the disbursement team. Just allow me a few seconds to do so, okay?

[02:00] [Brianna Albert]: Okay.

[02:01] [Devin]: Thank you. [ ... Silence (11s) ... ] Okay. Thank you so much for patiently holding on me, um, Brianna. So, I just double-checked and it seems like the check was made out and cut, um, on the 30th, which was last week. Um, I'm not sure if the check has been mailed out to you. That's what I'm trying to reach out to see what's going on.

[02:32] [Brianna Albert]: Yeah, 'cause he said he hasn't even received it from you guys.

[02:39] [Devin]: Mm-hmm. What happens is, I think they— they were made in the Atlanta office, well, by the accounting department that's in Atlanta. Normally, they would handle that. So I'm trying to understand if it was mailed out already, um, to Ohio, right, for that to be delivered to you, um, with more facility. But I'm not getting a response. I'm trying to reach Dante. He is one of our administrators to see what's going on. I'm so sorry you had to go through this. I— I do apologize you had to go through this. But we will get you the update, okay?

[03:27] [Brianna Albert]: Okay.

[03:28] [Devin]: [ ... Silence (21s) ... ] Let me see if the receptionist is closed. Allow me just a second.

[03:54] [Brianna Albert]: Okay.

[03:55] [Devin]: Thank you. Miss Albert, for patiently holding, I apologize again. Okay, so I tried reaching out to the administrators, but they are in a meeting this afternoon. Um, the receptionists as well, they are all in a meeting. I'm not getting any response. Um, I tried reaching out to the attorney, Mr. Kadeem Gibson, in regards to the possible knowledge of where the check is at the moment, because he would have that information directly. Um, by any chance, has he texted you any information or location to pick up the check or was this directly had to be mailed out to you? Do you know?

[04:41] [Brianna Albert]: Um, I haven't— I haven't gotten anything since I sent him the disbursement paper that I had to sign.

[04:59] [Devin]: The signed disbursement. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay.

[05:02] [Brianna Albert]: Yeah. And then I— and then he said that he'd sent it in and that he was still waiting for the, um...

[05:17] [Devin]: For the team to cut the check, basically.

[05:19] [Brianna Albert]: Yeah, he's saying he hasn't gotten it in the mail yet from whoever.

[05:29] [Devin]: Okay. So I'm going to explain to you what happened, maybe it got lost in translation, though. Um, the check was made by accounting last week. It was made on the 30th. This was signed by you, I think, around— let me double-check here. Yes, this was signed, everything was signed and completed, and it was sent to be checked, okay? They finalized this disbursement on the 30th. The check was made out. However, I don't— I'm not sure how or where it is right now. It's probably mailed out. He just hasn't received it. And he is not in the office physically today. He's probably at home. So he wouldn't have any idea, you know? But if he receives it, he will send you a message with a location to pick it up, which would be the office location, and any date that it would be for you. Normally, checks are made throughout the week for a Friday, to be delivered on a Friday. But I'm not sure if it's going to be next Friday that check is going to be ready for you to pick it up in Ohio, right?

[06:54] [Brianna Albert]: Okay.

[06:56] [Devin]: Because we are in Atlanta and that would be a big drive to come all the way here. [Laughs] And we don't want you to do that. We don't want you to go through that. No, of course not. We do not want that to happen. So we want you to go as the quickest place, you know, the nearest place for you possible, which would be in Ohio. So let me leave a message for him. Unfortunately, he is not in today. I— I tried reaching him and I found out he's not in. And I'm in the intake department, I'm a whole different department, so I'm not even near that office. Um, so let me leave a message for him and have him reach out to you as quick as possible. This might be by Monday, okay?

[07:45] [Brianna Albert]: Okay.

[07:47] [Devin]: And I once again, I do apologize about that.

[07:52] [Brianna Albert]: Okay. Uh, thank you.

[07:57] [Devin]: You're welcome, ma'am.
