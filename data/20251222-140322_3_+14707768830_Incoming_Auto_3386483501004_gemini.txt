[00:11] [Unknown]: Yes, is this Bey and Associates?
[00:13] [Receptionist]: It is.
[00:14] [Unknown]: Oh, I'm trying to reach Nick, he's my attorney. I think he said he was going to give me a call by 12:00 today and I didn't hear from him, so I'm just calling to double-check and make sure I didn't miss his call.
[00:22] [Receptionist]: Oh, absolutely. Please bear with me, sir, while I pull up your file and contact the attorney and see if um he is available for you. One moment, please. If I'm unable to contact the attorney, um can I contact your case manager, Ms. Wade, and see if she's available?
[00:41] [Unknown]: Yes.
[00:42] [Receptionist]: Yes, oh, one moment please and thank you.
