Well, I— I first uh filed a complaint with them in the office. Nobody contacted me. I had to call corporate to file a complaint with them. Um, someone emailed me really fast but nobody has really contacted me.
[00:37] [Receptionist]: Okay, but you said that nobody has contact you from— from here?
[00:43] [Whitney Ross]: No, no, no. From Chipotle.

Um, it— it originally— nobody in the store helped me, none of the associates tried to see if I was okay or anything. Um, I was having a bad day so I didn't really want to go to the— to the emergency room that day because I thought they were going to reach out and, you know, handle it.
