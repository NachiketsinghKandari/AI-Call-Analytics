----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bay and Associates Law Firm, Devon speaking.
[00:05] [Benji]: Hi, good morning Devon. My name is Benji, I'm calling from Stand Up MRI. I need to confirm representation on a mutual client... last name is Nord, N-O-R-D. First name R-E-V-E-N-E-L.
[00:28] [Receptionist]: N-O-R-D is the last name?
[00:33] [Benji]: Correct.
[00:34] [Receptionist]: And first name Revenel?
[00:38] [Benji]: Revenel, correct.
[00:42] [Receptionist]: Yes, so currently we do represent Revenel for that...
[00:44] [Benji]: Okay, and that's for July 26th?
[00:48] [Benji]: I'm sorry, go ahead, I'll listen. I was going to ask for the date of accident.
[00:53] [Receptionist]: So we have a date of loss of June 26th of this year.
[00:58] [Benji]: Okay, so we had July, so the date of accident is incorrect. Okay. And was this a slip and fall or motor vehicle accident?
[01:12] [Receptionist]: I'm sorry, they didn't quite hear you.
[01:13] [Benji]: Was this a slip and fall or motor vehicle accident?
[01:15] [Receptionist]: So this one seems like it's a motor vehicle accident, but I'm going to go through it real quick. I'm not familiar with this case. So let me go through it real quick and see what's going on. Let me give you the full disclosure.
[01:33] [Benji]: Mm-hmm.
[01:35] [Receptionist]: Yes, this was a motor vehicle accident to be exact.
[01:38] [Benji]: Okay, MVA. So, um, is this policy for Georgia? There's no PIP coverage because he's scheduled to come here in our Fort Lauderdale site.
[01:57] [Receptionist]: Uh, I don't think there's a PIP coverage. I'm not sure there was no claim filed with their insurance.
[02:05] [Benji]: Okay. So they do have insurance? Okay.
[02:08] [Receptionist]: They do. I can get you over to their case manager. She'll be able to give you more information regarding the case. Is that okay?
[02:14] [Benji]: Sure, thank you so much.
[02:16] [Receptionist]: All right, no problem. And just confirming here, you were calling from...
[02:22] [Benji]: Stand Up MRI.
[02:24] [Receptionist]: [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[02:30] [Receptionist]: Okay. Stand Up MRI, right?
[02:33] [Benji]: Correct.
[02:34] [Benji]: And can I have the name of the case manager just in case she doesn't pick up?
[02:39] [Receptionist]: Linda.
[02:41] [Benji]: Linda. Okay, thank you.
[02:43] [Receptionist]: Ooh, Linda's on another call. Um, I can give you her direct number and I can transfer you over to her voicemail and she'll return the call to you.
[02:50] [Benji]: Um, does she have an email? That would be much easier for me. I can shoot her a quick email.
[02:53] [Receptionist]: Yes, she does have an email.
[02:55] [Benji]: Yes, please.
[02:56] [Receptionist]: You can reach her to Linda, L-I-N-D-A.
[03:02] [Benji]: L-I-N-D-E-A?
[03:04] [Receptionist]: Yes, L-I-N as in Nancy D-A.
[03:07] [Benji]: Okay.
[03:08] [Receptionist]: So Linda at Bay and Associates dot com. And just making sure the spelling is correct, that's B as in boy, E as in Edward, Y as in Yankee for Bay. The word 'and' is spelled out, A-N-D, not the symbol. Associates is plural with an S as in Sam at the end dot com.
[03:49] [Benji]: Alright, thank you so much Devon.
[03:51] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. So, um, yeah, that's her email, but if you like you can leave her a voicemail and she'll return the call.
[03:59] [Benji]: Um, yeah, because I'm always on my phone, so the easiest way for me to be able to contact with her will be the email. So I'll send her an email.
[04:09] [Receptionist]: Alrighty, no problem.
[04:11] [Benji]: Thank you, have a great day.
[04:13] [Receptionist]: You too, have a great one.
[04:15] [Benji]: Thank you, bye-bye.
