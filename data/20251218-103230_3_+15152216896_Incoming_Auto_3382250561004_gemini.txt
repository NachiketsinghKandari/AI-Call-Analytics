[00:05] [Receptionist]: Bey and— Bless you.
[00:06] [Doug Abens]: Oh, thank you. You bet. No, hey, this is Doug Abens calling. I've been trying to get a hold of Taylor Middleton on a demand for a Shanesha Ragland. Um, I think I've left him like three calls and I haven't heard anything. I don't know if there's someone else working this case or if you guys don't represent this party anymore, but I was wondering if I could speak to someone on that.
[00:32] [Receptionist]: All right, you said Shanesha?
[00:35] [Doug Abens]: Shanesha Ragland. R-A-G-L-A-N-D. C-H-A-N-E-S-H-A. October 26th of '24 accident.
[00:49] [Receptionist]: Okay, this would be with um Paige Almond, she's the case manager. Let me get her for you.
[00:58] [Doug Abens]: If you could, that'd be great.
[01:01] [Receptionist]: All right, one second. I'm sorry, uh, did you say where you're calling from, sir?
[01:09] [Doug Abens]: I'm with AIG. AIG Insurance.
[01:13] [Receptionist]: AIG Insurance. Okay, one second.
