[15:05] [Renee]: Because I didn't see that one on my list. I didn't see that one on my list. But they got let's see how many Manji got now. M-O-N-G-S. Manji got 11. I just put one in probate. Look at— yeah, 11. I put one in probate. So all these is caught up and I mean you want to follow up you can but—
[15:31] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[15:34] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[15:38] [Renee]: It's one, two, three. It's three in P2P. Maryanne just did one. I reached out for Atlas and the other one the other one I reached out on 12/2. We are currently working on the balance with other providers. I mean, what you want me to do? I can't make it be ready. And the other— the other seven is SNN. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. We got one that's in OSC which I'm not fucking with. But it's only— yeah, it's only three that's in um that's promise to pay. Other ones is SNN. These are SNN. Chelsea put these—
[16:29] [Unknown]: Huh?
[16:30] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[16:36] [Renee]: Yeah, because because because I can't they they not responding. So whatever. Oh, because let me tell you what they do. When you send this like I got one on the list she said that the check cleared and she gave me the um check number, right? And I email them back and say we did not receive the payment. They're not going to respond. They're not going to respond to that because they feel as though that it's paid. They're not going to respond, but it's not paid.
[17:06] [Unknown]: Right.
[17:07] [Renee]: And you know and and that's with Bey. I I said to myself this afternoon when I spoke to Nadia. It's like I keep running into the same brick wall. It's like if it's settled and archived and we don't got our money and you email them and they don't respond, what the fuck you gonna do? So all the ones that says archive and settled, I'm going to put them on the list and send them to Christie and CC Kim. Because what you want me to do? I mean, I can if I I can send an email out to the ones who they tell me case manager but they but they they not responding because they feel as though it's already paid. Right. Right. It's archive. As soon as they go look at status archive, they they going to like shy away from it. Not all attorneys do because because um June Sanders is not like that. If you tell them something and they say well it wasn't on the list to be paid and I send them the HIPAA, they be like okay we'll send the money out right away. But these other ones they they not going to respond.
[18:20] [Unknown]: Right, right.
[18:22] [Renee]: It's like come on. But all the ones that says archive, I'm going to um put them on the list and send them to Christie and send them to um Kim. Because it don't make no sense for me to keep on following up and they going to just be like archive settled. It's crazy. This is just so fucking annoying.
[18:46] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[18:52] [Renee]: Yeah. Because you can't because you can't say oh let me send you a labor because they don't do labors. And they already pay every every week so you can't be like oh let me put it on a sheet because I put on the sheet every week. Right. Right. You know? Because you put on the sheet whoever put on the sheet I'm supposed to put on the sheet too. I put on the sheet every week.
[19:23] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[19:30] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[19:32] [Renee]: Not at all.
[19:34] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[19:38] [Renee]: Not at all. Not at all. Like she said, the check for this one was dispersed in July 2025 and she gave me the check number. So I email um the people back and they didn't respond back. So when I call her because because I just talked to her about I called her again because I got some in orange. So I said I was working on Bey. And when I call I know who to speak to. She she she'll take time because she just gave me 10. So she was like well I'm going to give you the COO because he was looking at this file. So I'm going to email the COO. [laughs]
[20:31] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[20:33] [Renee]: I'm I'm going to email him and see if he respond back. Right. That's what she told me to respond to, so that's who I'm going to respond to. That's who I'm going to respond to.
[20:45] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[20:52] [Renee]: So Manji.
[20:56] [Unknown]: Two and a half.
[20:58] [Renee]: For Manji?
[21:00] [Unknown]: Yes.
[21:01] [Renee]: I told you I just did those those those.
[21:04] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[21:12] [Renee]: Yeah. Manji was paying their ass off. They sent in a lot of checks. Because they had a lot on there too. They sent in a lot of checks. Yeah.
[21:26] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[21:36] [Renee]: Archive. A-R-C-H-I-V-E-D. Archive.
[21:45] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[21:48] [Renee]: Yeah, it's like what I don't know. I'm going to update these Bey ones. Oh, I got 15 minutes. I'll continue in the morning. I'm going to update the ones from Bey that I got and move on. I mean, if she want somebody else to follow up then fine with me.
[22:09] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[22:11] [Unknown]: She done made a whole spreadsheet.
[22:15] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[22:25] [Renee]: No, me neither.
[22:30] [Renee]: See like it's like it's archive. What what am I supposed to do if it's archive? I'm just going to just email them. Yeah. I mean, you ain't going to get no money out of it. Not right now. You don't get no money tomorrow. You ain't get no money tomorrow on none of these until they um get on the spreadsheet for Friday.
[22:55] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[23:10] [Renee]: Mm-hmm. I'm going to email these people she say email to and keep it popping. Yeah. But like I said, the ones that's archive, after I email them I wait I'm going to wait again. I'm going to wait I'm going to wait again, but they going to go on the list for archive and they not responding. Because because because once they go look in their in their in their system they're going to be like archive settled already paid. But I need to have a conversation with somebody because these these are are fucking annoying. Mm-hmm. Demesha Griggs. So then again I'm I'm going to email them again one more time and the new ones I got that says archive I'm going to still put them on the list. What you want us to do? Let somebody go over there and and talk to somebody. Do the do the right thing do do the hard ones that we can't get. This is so annoying.
[24:14] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[24:26] [Renee]: I do all mine. I do mine when I do when I do all of them. It don't make no sense to leave that one behind. I just do them all together. Like when I do like when I do June Sanders and SSN, I send her the whole sheet.
[24:47] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[24:51] [Renee]: Yeah, I don't I don't um yeah, I just do them all together.
[24:59] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[25:00] [Renee]: Because she was like these are SSNs. I do them all together.
[25:04] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[25:08] [Renee]: Yes, just yeah yeah. Why why skip that one? I don't understand. I don't understand.
[25:19] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[25:25] [Renee]: Yeah, I don't understand man. Oh my god.
[25:32] [Unknown]: [unintelligible]
[25:35] [Renee]: Yeah. I got like 10 minutes. I'm emailing as I go but these ones archive I got to put some I got to be able to flag I want to be able to flag the ones that's archive in in case manager instead of you know going to each one of them looking and looking and looking. It's like I want to be able to flag them, you know? But you can't.
