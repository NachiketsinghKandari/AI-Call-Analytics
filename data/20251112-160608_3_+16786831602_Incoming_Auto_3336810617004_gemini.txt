----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Dionel]: Thank you for calling Bay and Associate. This is Dionel.
[00:07] [Christy Lamorte]: Hi, my name's Christy. I see on your website that you guys help with the Suboxone lawsuit that's going on. And I think you're based in Atlanta. Is that right?
[00:18] [Dionel]: Yes, it's correct.
[00:21] [Christy Lamorte]: Okay. I am... I have my husband, he was prescribed Suboxone, um, and we are currently dealing with a ton of dental health issues with him. So I was hoping that it wasn't too late to get involved with this.
[00:34] [Dionel]: Okay, so yes, um, we definitely are able to, um, take a look and see if we can help. Um, so do you remember when he was prescribed for, um, for Suboxone?
[00:51] [Christy Lamorte]: He was... he was originally prescribed the year 2021.
[00:57] [Dionel]: 2021. Okay. And it was in film... let me check in a moment.
[01:02] [ ... Silence (22s) ... ]
[01:25] [Dionel]: So, um, you know that Suboxone comes in tablets and film. Um, what he was using?
[01:34] [Christy Lamorte]: Uh, he has actually used both, but um, primarily he was using films and then I think later on he switched to tablets because he thought maybe it wouldn't be so hard on his teeth. Um, but yeah, he is currently on Sublocade, so the injection version.
[01:54] [Dionel]: Okay. The injection version. Okay. Okay, yes, if he... if he was using, um, the both of them, um, we can take a look at the case and see if we are able to help. Um, is he with you right now?
[02:11] [Christy Lamorte]: He's not with me right now. He's actually getting his teeth worked on right now, like it's been a whole ordeal. It's been horrible.
[02:20] [Dionel]: Oh, I can only imagine. Okay, yes, um, so in this case, um, if you can give us a call back with him on the line so we can complete his intake process. That's the only thing we have to do.
[02:32] [Christy Lamorte]: Okay. Oh, okay. So you can't do it with me, like get it started with me?
[02:37] [Dionel]: Um, yeah, we... we can, but normally, um, we need to send contracts and gather some other information as well that needs to be signed by him.
[02:47] [Christy Lamorte]: Okay, got it. Yeah, he's... he'll be available in about an hour or two.
[02:53] [Dionel]: May I have your name and phone number?
[02:56] [Christy Lamorte]: It is Christy, C-H-R-I-S-T-Y, last name Lamorte, L-A-M-O-R-T-E, and are you ready for my phone number?
