[00:19] [Receptionist]: Sure, let me go ahead and double check that for you, Lourdes. Can I please have the name for the client?
[00:28] [Lourdes]: Yes, first name is Vanessa, that's V-A-N-E-S-S-A, and last name is Barrera, that's B as in Bravo, A-R-R-E-R-A.
[00:42] [Receptionist]: Yes, actually we represent her and the case is in litigation. But one minute because I'm reading here something. Please hold. Plaintiff's understanding representation is unable to reach the client, does not answer... okay, but actually here in the system says termination. It looks like that the client has like a new representation or like a new attorney, alright?
