[00:03] SPEAKER 1: This is Angela from Diana. How may I you?
[00:15] SPEAKER 2: Hello?
[00:17] SPEAKER 1: Angelo speaking. How may I help you?
[00:21] SPEAKER 2: I'm sorry. I could finally hear you. Hi, Angelo. How are you doing today?
[00:25] SPEAKER 1: So good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you?
[00:29] SPEAKER 2: Quick question. I am and I have a case opened up a case with you guys. However, I was trying to get to the tow company in order to clean up my car my vehicle after an accident. They mentioned something about an insurance claim number, but I was under the impression that the law office what the attorney was going to handle all of that. I just wanted to make sure that it was okay for me to call contact the insurance company in opening up a claim, or is that something that the attorney is supposed to do?
[01:03] SPEAKER 1: Either both. I mean, you can open a claim for your end, right, which is normal, or you can ask for the alternative to open a claim on your behalf. Alright? We will need to get your authorization. So either or both is fine.
[01:20] SPEAKER 1: So you can open by yourself or we can open for you.
[01:24] SPEAKER 2: Okay. Alright. That's all I really needed. Thank you so much.
[01:27] SPEAKER 1: You are more than welcome. Have a good one. Take care.
[01:30] SPEAKER 2: You as well. Bye bye.
