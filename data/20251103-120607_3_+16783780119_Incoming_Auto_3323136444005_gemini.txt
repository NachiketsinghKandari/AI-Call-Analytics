----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: B and Associates Law Firm, Devon speaking.
[00:06] [Chris Starks]: Is this Devon? Well, my name is Chris Starks, I'm calling on behalf of my wife, Martha Starks.
[00:12] [Receptionist]: Martha?
[00:14] [Chris Starks]: Yes.
[00:16] [Receptionist]: Let me pull up the file real quick.
[00:23] [ ... Silence (8s) ... ]
[00:32] [Receptionist]: Now, may I have the last name please so I make sure I have the correct file pulled up?
[00:41] [Chris Starks]: Starks, S-T-A-R-K-S, Starks.
[00:44] [Receptionist]: Yes, got it here for Ms. Martha Starks. Um, so Mr. Starks, you're calling in regards to the case, you want to speak with the attorney for a follow-up?
[00:53] [Chris Starks]: Uh, yes.
[00:56] [Receptionist]: Okay. So let me go ahead and get you connected, alright?
[01:02] [Receptionist]: I'm sorry about that. Mr. Starks, looks like the case manager, Paige, is on the phone right now. She's on with another client. Would you like me to have her call you back?
[01:12] [Chris Starks]: Well, no, I just wanted to relay some information. I got the police report today and, um, I spoke with the insured, uh, insurance company and, um, trying to get a rental car for my wife and she said to me, she said to me that she needed to, um, they needed to do all whatever they needed to do before they can get her a car, but she could go ahead and get a car and they'll refund her. And I said to my— my wife don't have the money for that. And she said, well, um, they, the way they do it is, you know, uh, they can't just get her a car. So I said, uh, well, I'm just going to reach out to an attorney, you know, and, um, I'll just let them handle it. So I wanted to give you all the information to the, to the adjuster, uh, whoever, to the adjuster and the claim number that they, that they gave us and everything. And, um, that way, uh, you guys can do the bid for her. I mean, I, I'm not legally minded. I just, uh, I'm just a guy who run around. Alright.
[02:23] [Receptionist]: So, by any chance, sir, is this the, um, insurance company you're talking about is United Auto Insurance?
[02:33] [Chris Starks]: That's correct.
[02:35] [Receptionist]: Okay, so they gave you a claim number for the accident already?
[02:39] [Chris Starks]: Well, uh, yes, they just gave it to me a little while ago.
[02:43] [Receptionist]: Okay. Do you mind providing it to me, please?
[02:45] [Chris Starks]: The claim number is 0100433978. And the adjuster is Dav— Davilet, D-A-V-I-L-E-T. And her extension, oh, you have the phone number. Uh, you do, I don't know if you have it.
[03:12] [Receptionist]: What is her phone number?
[03:14] [Chris Starks]: You don't have the phone number?
[03:16] [Receptionist]: No, sir.
[03:18] [Chris Starks]: The phone number is, um, 305-940-7299, extension 32618. And, um, she said that, um, something about that her insured only have $10,000 worth of property damage and that it would, that that's to cover both vehicles. I told her, ma'am, you must be out of your mind. And, um, I said, I can't handle this legal stuff. I'm going to have the attorney talk to you. And, um, from then on out, whatever's going on with my wife, I want, if you guys will represent her, then, um, I'm going to let y'all handle it. I'm not going to get involved in no legal stuff.
[04:06] [Receptionist]: Right, right. No problem. Um, we are going to go ahead and get a hold of them right now. We have someone working on the file as we speak. Um, but I will have Paige reach out to her, to you or to Ms. Starks as quick as possible. Um, but we will have someone reach out to—
[04:22] [Chris Starks]: Just reach out to my wife.
[04:24] [Receptionist]: Okay. No problem, sir. I can have that arranged. Do you mind respelling the name of that adjuster? I want to make sure I have it correct.
[04:31] [Chris Starks]: Her name is D-A-V-I-L-E-T, Davilet, and her last name is A-R-C-E. And, um, that's the only legal work I'm going to do. Okay. Like I told her, I'm not a lawyer and I don't do administrative stuff. I'm just, and, um, I know how to do this stuff. I'm just, I'm just not, it's not my place.
[04:59] [Receptionist]: Okay. Now, you mentioned that the police report was ready. So you have a copy of that already?
[05:05] [Chris Starks]: I have the police report.
[05:09] [Receptionist]: Okay, perfect. We have one already as well. We just got it, actually, a few seconds ago. So I'm going to go ahead and inform the—
[05:19] [Chris Starks]: But, hold it. One thing else, uh, Mr. Donald, right? Alexis. One other thing on the police report, I was waiting for this deputy to call me because he said on driver number three, he said that her vehicle, once the guy hit her, it ran into, hit the driver number three. But that's not what my wife said. My wife said her car was standing still and that car ran into her. Now, now, that's what, but they have a video, so you guys should be able to look at the video and determine whether or not the other car hit my wife's car or if her car hit the other car, I mean the other driver's car.
[06:00] [Chris Starks]: Well, I mean, y'all know what to do. All I'm saying is if the vehicle hit my wife, I want them to be responsible as well as the, their insured too, you know?
[06:17] [Receptionist]: Yes, so based on the police report, that's how the agent is going to work the file, okay? So if there's any investigation, they will go through it as well, right? Just to make sure everything is covered. Okay?
[06:27] [Chris Starks]: Yes, sir.
[06:29] [Receptionist]: No problem.
[06:32] [Chris Starks]: It's out of my hands.
[06:34] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much. No problem.
[06:37] [Chris Starks]: Thank you, sir. Alright, bye-bye.
[06:39] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. Bye-bye.
