----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, Kimmy speaking?
[00:05] [Carlotta Hughes]: Yes, is Ms. Millicent available? She just called me a few minutes ago. This is Ms. Hughes returning her call.
[00:12] [Receptionist]: All right, one second, let me see.
[00:14] [Carlotta Hughes]: Thank you.
[00:16] [Receptionist]: Oh no, her phone is already off. She must have already left.
[00:22] [Carlotta Hughes]: Hmm. Okay. What's her first name?
[00:25] [Receptionist]: Hmm?
[00:26] [Carlotta Hughes]: Is her first name Taylor?
[00:29] [Receptionist]: Yes, ma'am.
[00:30] [Carlotta Hughes]: I thought so. Taylor Millicent. I said, "That's my lawyer's number, let me call her back." Hmm. It was literally two minutes ago. You don't think she's still in the building? Because I've been calling her for two months to get no answer, and yesterday I spoke to someone, so for her to call me back, I know, like, I need to speak to her if possible.
[00:51] [Receptionist]: Okay. Can I have your name?
[00:52] [Carlotta Hughes]: Yes, baby. It's Carlotta Hughes.
[00:55] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay, Ms. Hughes. Give me one second, let me see if I could get ahold of Ms. Britney, maybe she can stop her if she's already left the building.
[01:02] [Carlotta Hughes]: Okay. Okay. I appreciate you, queen.
[01:05] [Receptionist]: You're welcome.
[01:06] [Carlotta Hughes]: Yes, ma'am.
[01:12] [Receptionist]: Ms. Hughes, I'm sorry for the hold up. I tried, um, getting ahold of Ms. Britney also, but she didn't answer, neither did Taylor.
[01:22] [Carlotta Hughes]: Okay. I— are you guys closed tomorrow, aren't you?
[01:25] [Receptionist]: Yes, ma'am. Until Monday.
[01:27] [Carlotta Hughes]: That's what I thought. Oh god. I've been trying to reach this lady since September 20th. This is ridiculous. I will try back on Monday again. Maybe she'll even be kind and call me back. I'll cross my fingers. Ugh. She's very hard to get in touch with. It's just, like, I've never seen nothing like it.
[01:46] [Receptionist]: Okay. I'll go ahead and task her so she can reach out to you.
[01:49] [Carlotta Hughes]: Thank you, precious. I appreciate you. Sorry to be your headache and thanks for trying for me.
[01:52] [Receptionist]: No problem. You have a great rest of your day and weekend.
[01:55] [Carlotta Hughes]: All right, you too. Bye-bye.
