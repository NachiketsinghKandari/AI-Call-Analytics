[00:07] [Harold Harvey]: Devon?
[00:08] [Receptionist]: Yes sir.
[00:10] [Harold Harvey]: Yeah, are you in the Macon office?
[00:15] [Receptionist]: I'm not directly in the Macon, but I can get you a hold of someone.
[00:22] [Harold Harvey]: Um, well I'll tell you who I called. I'm Harold Harvey and we're sponsoring a 50-year legacy celebration for the first blacks elected to the Macon City Council. They were elected, um, in 1975 and this is the 50th anniversary of that event. And we're holding a celebratory, um, luncheon for them and I had sent earlier in the year I had sent correspondence seeking sponsorships from the firm, since you guys operate in Macon, my hometown. And, um, but I've never received a response back. We're coming up on the December 12th date for the event and so I'm trying to finalize my sponsorships and so forth and that was why I was making a phone call today. Not quite sure who I should speak with, but maybe you can direct me.
[01:01] [Receptionist]: Okay. And this email that was sent, was sent to what address?
[01:07] [Harold Harvey]: Uh, actually it wasn't sent by email, I sent snail mail to, um, to 963 Washington Avenue, Macon, Georgia.
[01:31] [Receptionist]: Okay. All right. Um, definitely you want to speak with, um, Donte Thompson. He is Mr. John Bey's personal assistant. Um, I can get you transferred over to his line to have any conversations regarding that. Okay? Um, unfortunately he is not available, um, on the phone right now, but if you leave a message or shoot him a quick email, he will more definitely want to respond. I can provide you with the email and number. Okay?
[01:53] [Harold Harvey]: I certainly would appreciate it. Okay. I'm ready.
[01:57] [Receptionist]: So his number is 404...
[02:00] [Harold Harvey]: Okay.

[02:31] [Harold Harvey]: Okay. All right. Um, okay, I'll, I'll send a email over.
[02:37] [Receptionist]: Perfect, perfect. All righty. Thank you so much.
