[00:06] [Receptionist]: Vand and Associates, Kim speaking.
[00:09] [Christopher Brudamesso]: Yeah, this is Christopher Brudamesso from Progressive. Um, I'm sorry, uh, to bother you today. Um, I was just calling in today about your client Samantha Bass and trying to see if I can get a hold of anyone on this case. I've been trying to get a hold of this Matt McCarron person, but they've basically ignored me the last couple months in emails and voicemails and everything like that. I just have nowhere else to go.
[00:39] [Receptionist]: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me get the case manager. Her name is Linda Huff.
[00:46] [Christopher Brudamesso]: She says I have- I spoke to her and she says I have to speak with Matt. So I don't know if there's anyone above Matt that I could speak to because I just- I don't know.
[00:56] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me check what- to see if he's available right now. One second.
