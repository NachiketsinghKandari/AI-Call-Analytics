----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Hello, this is Angelo, how may I help you?
[00:05] [Grant Horlander]: Uh, good afternoon. Uh, my name is Grant Horlander and I'm calling from the Rollins Company on behalf of Florida Blue on a recorded line. But how are you doing today, sir?
[00:16] [Receptionist]: I'm doing good, thanks so much for asking. What about you?
[00:19] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, no problem. Uh, do pretty good, do pretty good also. Thank you for asking as well.
[00:26] [Receptionist]: And tell me how may I help you?
[00:29] [Grant Horlander]: Well, uh, I just had a few questions regarding a client of yours and I can go ahead and provide you that client's name and date of loss if you'd like.
[00:40] [Receptionist]: Of course, please, can I have it? I'm ready.
[00:43] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, so the client's name is Thomas Josephson.
[00:52] [ ... Silence (15s) ... ]
[01:07] [Receptionist]: Hey, how do you spell that last name?
[01:18] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, sorry, I think I may have pronounced that incorrect. Uh, so it's Joseph-son, Joseph-son. I apologize, it's Joseph J-O-S-E-P-H and then S-O-N.
[01:33] [Receptionist]: Thank you. Can I have the date of loss?
[01:37] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, so the date of loss for Thomas is October 12th of 2024.
[01:43] [Receptionist]: Thank you for confirming that information, sir. Please tell me how may I help you.
[01:49] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, well, I'm actually just trying to figure out the best mailing address and fax number, um, for you guys along with the, uh, person handling the case. I believe it's looks like Tara Chapman is the most recent correspondence we've, uh, been sent. And it looks like there's a whole bunch of different mailing addresses for you guys. I'm trying to look for a Florida office since this accident occurred in Florida.
[02:24] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me go ahead and connect you with the case manager, uh, just to see if she can provide you further information, okay? Let me give you and let me explain the situation for you. So you're saying that you're calling for the Rolling Company. What is that? That is a medical center, insurance company?
[02:44] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, so we are a subrogation company and we are acting on behalf of Thomas's health provider, uh, which is Florida Blue.
[02:56] [Receptionist]: Segregation company? Uh, just to confirm what is that for? Just to explain to the case manager.
[03:06] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, so, uh, it it's a subro- subrogation, um, and yeah, sorry about that. It sounds, yeah, very similar to the other word that's not good. Um, but yeah, so subrogation, it's, um, we basically are a third party that, uh, tries to recover funds that was paid by the, uh, health provider for, um, yeah.
[03:39] [Receptionist]: All right. All right, let me consult with the with the case manager. Please hold on. Let me consult.
[03:45] [Grant Horlander]: Awesome, thank you so much.
[03:47] [Receptionist]: Sure.
[03:48] [ ... Silence (10s) ... ]
[03:58] [Receptionist]: Thank you for staying on the line. So it looks like the case manager is unavailable at this moment. Uh, but just to confirm, would you like to get the mailing address or the mailing address in Florida, you said?
[04:09] [Grant Horlander]: Yeah, so I didn't see one listed. Do you guys have a- an office in Florida?
[04:14] [Receptionist]: No, actually we only work in Georgia and in Ohio so far for personal injuries. And here in the system shows that this client live in Georgia, in Lithia Spring, Georgia, and the accident happened or it occurred in Georgia. So that's the only information we have. Do you wish if I can give you the the address from our office in Georgia, just in case?
[04:46] [Grant Horlander]: Gotcha. So does the Thomas Josephson, did it say that his accident occurred in Georgia?
[04:56] [Receptionist]: Uh, yes, actually we complete- we did the intake. The intake is all the questionnaire for the questions and everything. And we have the police report and it shows in Georgia. And I can see he lives there. Yes, because if it- if it occurred in Florida, we need to decline it because as I said or as I mentioned before, we handle Georgia and Ohio cases only as a law firm. Mhm. Nothing in Florida.
[05:30] [Grant Horlander]: Gotcha. That is odd. Yeah, because the client or, um, the company we're working for on this file is supposed to be, uh, Florida Blue, which is- which is odd. And it shows here on our file that the patient state and accident state are both in Florida. That is odd.
[05:56] [Receptionist]: Yes, it's kind of strange because everything here says Georgia.
[06:02] [Grant Horlander]: Gotcha.
[06:03] [Receptionist]: Mhm. Yes, but anyways, if you wish like to double check, get more information or something, uh, what I can do for you is I can give you the email from the case manager. Actually she reply really fast. You can reply with your question, maybe you have any additional question. Maybe something happened in Florida, maybe his insurance, his vehicle, his license plates, something. So if you wish, I can give you the the email and you can ask her since she's the person in charge.
[06:45] [Grant Horlander]: Gotcha. All right, yeah, that would be great. Yeah, if you have the case manager's name and phone number as well as the email, that would be great.
[06:56] [Receptionist]: Sure. Ready?
[06:59] [Grant Horlander]: Uh, yes sir.
[07:01] [Receptionist]: I'm going to spell the name and that is the first initial for the email as well, okay? So her name is P-A-Y-G-E, like Payge. And the email, it is the same as the first name, Payge at B-E-Y-A-N-D-A-S-S-O-C-I-A-T-E-S with an S at the end dot com. That is her email. Payge at beyandassociates.com. And the telephone number, it is the following. It is 4-7-0-6-1-5-0-7-1-5. That is her direct line. You can call her just in case.
[07:57] [Grant Horlander]: Gotcha. All right. And do you have, uh, Payge's, uh, what's it called, uh, Payge's last name by any chance?
[08:09] [Receptionist]: Uh, I have the first initial. For security purposes we can say only the first initial. It is A for apple. Payge A.
[08:19] [Grant Horlander]: Gotcha. All right. Well, yeah, I, uh, appreciate you letting me know that, sir. And, yeah, we're going to do some- do some digging and see if we can figure out what's going on here with, uh, with our file. But yeah, thank you so much, sir. I appreciate your help today.
[08:41] [Receptionist]: No issue at all. Anything else that I can assist you or that's all?
[08:45] [Grant Horlander]: Uh, I think that's all for today. I think that's all for today. But yeah, thank you so much, sir.
[08:50] [Receptionist]: You're more than welcome. Have a nice rest of your day. Take care. Bye-bye.
[08:54] [Grant Horlander]: Yes sir. You as well. Thank you. Bye-bye.
