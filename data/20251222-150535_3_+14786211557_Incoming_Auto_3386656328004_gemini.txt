[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Matt speaking, how can I help you?
[00:05] [Christina Vesterick]: Hi, um, my name is Christina Vesterick from the GEICO claims department on a recorded line. Um, I was follow— following up on a client, Larry Lugo.
[00:16] [Receptionist]: One moment. What's the date of loss?
[00:20] [Christina Vesterick]: Uh, looks like it's December 16th of this year.
[00:24] [Receptionist]: Okay, I've got the file pulled up. How can I help you?
[00:26] [Christina Vesterick]: Um, I've just been assigned to the claim. Um, from my understanding, it looks like you guys are probably already getting a letter of rep over. Is that correct?
[00:34] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I think it's... let me see when it went out. But yeah, it went out today.
[00:42] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay, all right. Then I'll keep an eye on it then. Um, I can't discuss the claim details in full on my end until I get that letter of rep, but I was hoping I could get some missing information updated related to your client.
[00:53] [Receptionist]: Mhm.
[00:54] [Christina Vesterick]: Um, I did want to confirm, do you know if your client has Medicare or Medicaid?
[00:58] [Receptionist]: No, he's 26.
[01:02] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. Does he have Medicaid?
[01:04] [Receptionist]: I... I do not see any on file.
[01:07] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. Does he or did he have any minors or passengers in the vehicle with him?
[01:14] [ ... Silence (10s) ... ]
[01:24] [Receptionist]: None... none reported, no.
[01:26] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay, cool. All right, get that updated. And do we know, um, what his reported injuries are?
[01:33] [Receptionist]: Yeah, one sec. Neck pain, headaches, upper and lower back, and shoulder.
[01:44] [Christina Vesterick]: Upper and lower back and shoulder. Okay. And do we know what type of treatment he's completed so far?
[01:54] [ ... Silence (11s) ... ]
[02:05] [Receptionist]: Uh, he's at a chiropractor, no hospital visit.
[02:11] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. Um, just that. And what's the name of the chiropractor?
[02:18] [Receptionist]: It's like Arrowhead Clinics.
[02:22] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. Arrowhead. Do you know if there's been any imaging done?
[02:28] [Receptionist]: Uh, I don't know yet.
[02:30] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. Do you know if he has any injections planned?
[02:34] [Receptionist]: I... I don't have any details on the treatment. Okay. I mean, I think it just happened on the 16th, so...
[02:44] [Christina Vesterick]: Ah, you'd be surprised what I see. Okay. All right. And do we know, um, do you know if he plans or has already has any lost wages we might have to consider?
[02:55] [Receptionist]: Uh, there's nothing in the file to that... about that one way or the other yet.
[03:00] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. So we don't know his occupation yet then either.
[03:04] [Receptionist]: Uh... let's see if it's noted.
[03:07] [ ... Silence (21s) ... ]
[03:28] [Receptionist]: Uh, no lost wages documented at this stage.
[03:31] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. And we don't know his occupation either then.
[03:34] [Receptionist]: Not yet, no.
[03:35] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. All right, cool. That was everything I needed. Once I get, um, the letter of rep, I'll give you a call and we can go a little bit more detail. Um, do you know, does your firm allow recorded statements?
[03:49] [Receptionist]: We don't, no.
[03:51] [Christina Vesterick]: Okay. Well, that's everything I need. All right, awesome. Then I will touch base once I get that letter of rep on my end.
