----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling Bey and Associates, this is Dinel.
[00:07] [Nikeshia Jennings]: I'm sorry, good morning?
[00:09] [Receptionist]: Good morning.
[00:12] [Nikeshia Jennings]: I can't hear you that well.
[00:15] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling Bey and Associates, this is Dinel.
[00:21] [Nikeshia Jennings]: Hi Dinel, how are you doing this morning?
[00:23] [Receptionist]: Fine, what about you?
[00:26] [Nikeshia Jennings]: I'm doing well, thank you. I'm um, actually calling as a past customer. Um, I was wondering if I might be able to speak to someone about an accident that happened.
[00:43] [Receptionist]: Yes, um, you are talking to the intake department, so um, I can speak to you about the car accident.
[00:53] [Nikeshia Jennings]: So on November the 28th at around like 9:00, I was in an accident on I-20 in Conyers, Georgia, between West Avenue and 138. And it was like a car pile-up type of incident, so there's multiple cars in the accident. However, the vehicle that I hit in the accident left the scene. Okay. The officer gave me a ticket for following too closely because he could not reconstruct the accident. However, he did not make me sign the ticket. Um, I did go to the hospital, I did not ride in the ambulance. Um, my family member came to the accident scene where I was and they took me to the emergency room in Rockdale. And then I stayed for a few hours for them to run a few CAT scans, but I left because I had to use the restroom. Um, I went back to the Newton County hospital on that following Monday and they gave me a lot of pain meds because I'm in a lot of pain. I really messed my back up. Like, everything came back clean, of course, on the CAT scans. I'm grateful to be alive because the car is totaled. Like I said, the vehicle that I hit left the scene, but I hit a truck and after I hit the truck, I hit the wall.
[01:30] [Receptionist]: Okay. And you said it was on November the 20th?
[01:35] [Nikeshia Jennings]: 28th. November 28th. So this was um, Friday, the 28th.
[01:41] [Receptionist]: Well, let me check the police report um, before making any um, decision.
[01:50] [Nikeshia Jennings]: Okay. Um, my cousin has my police report in her car, but I did go speak with my um, insurance company today, so they said it's already um, on file with my um, my insurance. However, I do have a question.
[02:07] [Receptionist]: Yes.
[02:09] [Nikeshia Jennings]: In the state of Georgia, with um, if if there is a car stalled in a lane, any lane, however, I'm in the fast lane, so this was on a Friday night, 9:00 in the evening, I can't see, there is a car literally sitting in the fast lane that I can't see ahead of me. So in the pictures that I have, you can see a car sitting by the median, a car behind it, then there was a truck that I was behind and I'm assuming after I hit that truck, that truck hit the car that was sitting there. But that truck is not there, they left. But they gave me the ticket.
[03:01] [Receptionist]: Yeah, um, you know, I will, I can go ahead and try to obtain your police report um, with your driver's license and I can send it to the attorney for review to see what's the options.
[03:19] [Nikeshia Jennings]: Okay. Can you please do that for me and I can give you a callback number as well?
[03:20] [Receptionist]: Yes, what is your driver's license number?
[03:22] [Nikeshia Jennings]: It's 046980198.
[03:31] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[03:33] [Nikeshia Jennings]: Like I said, I wasn't speeding, no drinking, no DUI, nothing like that. I was literally just in the fast lane going 60, 65. There is absolutely no way I can immediately stop on brakes if a car is sitting in the fast lane. So the truck that was in front of me, they stopped, I stopped as much as I could, but I still hit them. I had no other choice but to hit the car in front of me, swerve into the middle lane into oncoming traffic, or hit the median. All I seen was brake lights.
[04:20] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[04:22] [Nikeshia Jennings]: Even the officer was like, like when he pulled up, he was like, "Oh my God, ma'am, are you okay? I can't, I don't even know what to say because what happened?"
[04:37] [Receptionist]: So wow. It was just really that crazy for real.
[04:42] [Nikeshia Jennings]: I can only imagine.
[04:44] [Receptionist]: Okay, so let me go ahead and try to obtain your police report. What is the callback number?
[04:52] [Nikeshia Jennings]: It's 678-743-6377.
[04:59] [Receptionist]: Okay. Okay, and you are um, Nikeshia Jennings, right?
[05:19] [Nikeshia Jennings]: Nikeshia Jennings. And I have been a prior client with Shakedria Taylor. We were in a car accident maybe like three or four years ago, so my name should already be in you all's file.
[05:24] [Receptionist]: Okay, understood. Okay, I will be getting your police report and giving you a callback, okay?
[05:32] [Nikeshia Jennings]: All right, thank you. Have a good day.
[05:35] [Receptionist]: You too.
[05:37] [Nikeshia Jennings]: All right, bye-bye.
