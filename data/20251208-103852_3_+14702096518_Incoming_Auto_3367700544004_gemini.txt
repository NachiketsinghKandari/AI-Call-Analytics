----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates Law Firm, this is Kyrie speaking, how can I help you today?
[00:05] [Sitan Simaga]: Hi, hello. Um, this is Sitan Simaga and I just want— I just had a question. Do you guys first do like, uh, like free consultation if I just told you the situation of a recent car accident or...
[00:19] [Receptionist]: Free consultations?
[00:22] [Sitan Simaga]: Like if I just told you because I'm asking— I kind of have a question if like this is something I could get a lawyer for, if that's really what it is.
[00:34] [Receptionist]: And what kind of incident did you have?
[00:38] [Sitan Simaga]: So someone rear-ended me Saturday, right? Someone rear-ended me Saturday and there's no physical exterior damage on my vehicle. Um, however, the complication is that I, um, went back to do the— I didn't do a police report right then and there because I had a very important interview to make. But I went back to the scene the next day and I made a police report. And, um, you know, the police officer made the report as normal, but and I have her information and everything, but I don't know if that complicates things.
[01:18] [Receptionist]: Well, if you did the police report, I don't believe there's going to be any issue if all the information is there. Now, were you at fault in some point of the—
[01:27] [Sitan Simaga]: No, it was a rear-end accident.
[01:29] [Receptionist]: A rear-end, okay. Um, yes, so we do. Did you have any injuries? Did you go to the hospital?
[01:39] [Sitan Simaga]: So, um, I was feeling back pain. Um, I have not yet, um, made an appointment to the hospital because I did want to also ask, like, um, do I go— like if I was to, you know, further this claim and everything, what would it be best? Because I know, you know, the— as long as you're prolonging, you know, the situation, it's like it gets more diluted. But, um, is it best to go to a doctor or a— like a phys— a chiropractor? Or is that chiropractor's like second?
[02:16] [Receptionist]: Chiropractor. Well, if— if we do get to represent you, we do refer you to chiropractics and, you know, all those kind of treatments depending on your injuries. Um, so— but that is if we do represent you. Now, we do work with a lot of rear-ended accidents, right? Which is a motor vehicle accident. So what I can do right now is that I can go ahead and do your intake process, right? Get your information, get everything, and we can definitely send it over for review with an attorney so just to see if they're going to represent you or not. I don't know if you would have to— would like to do that.

Uh, the light turned green and, uh, you know, we were beginning to move and the lady behind me rear-ended me. Now, we pulled over and, you know, I got her— exchanged information. There was no exterior damage to my vehicle. Um, we still exchanged information, however, because I had to make it to an interview. Um, so I decided to file the police report the very next day at the exact scene, and there was a witness. So, um, I went back to the scene and the police officer came and we, um, did the police report with her information. So that is the little like problem, but I don't know if that— if that affects things.
