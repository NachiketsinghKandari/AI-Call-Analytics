[02:13] [Receptionist]: Um, no, I still do not have that information. That's going to be with Paige. No, I'm so sorry. Just go ahead and send her any information that you need, and she will reply.
[02:25] [Renee]: Okay. And you said it was settled, right?
[02:28] [Receptionist]: Uh, yes, it is closed. It's all closed. All righty.
