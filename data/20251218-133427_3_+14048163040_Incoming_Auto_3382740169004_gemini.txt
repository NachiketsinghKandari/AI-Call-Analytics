----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Hello, this is Angel, how may I help you?
[00:05] [Unknown]: Hi, um, we are looking for an attorney that could, um, would be able to represent us in a bad faith claim against a health healthcare insurance company.
[00:19] [Receptionist]: Um, sure, can you tell me a little bit more what happened just to find out if it's a case and we can proceed?
[00:27] [Unknown]: Yes, yes, yes, yes. So, um, I'm calling for Stephanie Bell, Stephanie, I work for her, and, you know, it's just we're screening, right? We have to, it's hard to find somebody. But, um, so in May of this year, Stephanie started feeling some weird sensations and so she went to the ER, right? And they did a CAT scan and so anyway, and it kept going, right? You know, from go to this doctor, from one doctor to another scan, MRI, all in-network. And no one was and as this was happening she was becoming less and less mobile. Um, she couldn't even stand or sit up for longer than 5, 10 minutes and she was determining that she had a spinal leak and her brain was also dropping because when you when you have the leak, it's not, you know, coating around your anyway, it's more anyway, that's too specific. But in any event, um, it's debilitating and if it doesn't get taken care of, it's further neurological issues and there was only one out-of-network provider that was able to actually diagnose her properly and and do the surgery. But Ambetter denied, um, covering her for it. And so she paid out of pocket around $160,000, um, and we have everything, we have all the files, all the medical, all the insurance coverage, we have surge- letters from the doctors, um, and that's kind of where we're at. Yeah.
[02:02] [Receptionist]: Oh, I see. But just to confirm, it was any medical malpractice or it was just because they didn't pay the bill, basically?
[02:12] [Unknown]: No, just the insur- no medical malpractice, everything went perfect medically like with the surgeons and the facilities, but it's just the actual health insurance that she pays for refused to pay to help co- you know, refused to cover this treatment or any of it, any authorization, um, yeah. And we understand that that is not okay, right? That there's I know the law is very gray and a lot of loopholes, but, um, there basically there was no in-network provider, the one, you know, in-network, that was able to help her. So she was forced to go out-of-network and then they didn't want to step in. Yeah.
[02:55] [Receptionist]: I see, I see what you mean. Let me go ahead and consult this information with the attorney. Give me just one to two minutes, let me explain.
[03:04] [Unknown]: Okay. Do you need any more information? Was that was that good enough, a good enough summary? Because, you know, I have all the every detail. Okay, thank you.
[03:11] [Receptionist]: So far we have everything, so I'm going to consult if we can proceed. If we can proceed, we are going to ask for medical records and everything. Yes.
[03:18] [Unknown]: That would be great. Yeah. Okay, wonderful. Appreciate it. Yes, thank you.
[03:22] [Receptionist]: Thank you. Give me just one to two minutes. Thank you.
[03:25] [Unknown]: Sure, sure, take your time. Thank you.

[ ... Silence (10s) ... ]

[03:37] [Receptionist]: Thank you for staying on the line. So I was consulting this information with the attorney. Hello? Yes.
[03:43] [Unknown]: I'm sorry, hold on. What'd you say? Hello? Yes.
[03:47] [Receptionist]: Sure, no worries. Can you hear me now?
[03:49] [Unknown]: I can, yes.
[03:51] [Receptionist]: Sure, no worries. I said that I consult with the attorney and so far they said that they were more like negligence in this case for for the surgery or the treatment and everything for for her. So far they said that we handle body injuries. Since everything was perfect, there is no any medical malpractice or something, they said that we can go we cannot go ahead and proceed with the case because it is more like negligence.
[04:11] [Unknown]: You say what kind of negligence? Like...
[04:15] [Receptionist]: Because they didn't pay the bills, they didn't pay everything from their end. So I explain for them, for the attorney, that they the health insurance didn't pay.
[04:25] [Unknown]: And they don't and they don't yeah, and they don't that's not a bad faith claim? They don't take care of that?
[04:29] [Receptionist]: Since it wasn't any body injuries, the attorney says no. Everything went perfect, there is there is no any medical malpractice or something. That can be consulted for an attorney, yes, but not for this law firm because we only handle body injuries. Maybe with Morgan & Morgan, with another different law firm that takes those kind of cases for negligence and everything about payment, you know? Mm-hmm. Totally.
[04:58] [Unknown]: Okay. Okay, yeah, it's hard to find. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you for trying. Thank you though. Thank you so much.
[05:05] [Receptionist]: No an issue at all. Sorry for anything, okay? Have an excellent rest of your day.
[05:09] [Unknown]: You too, have a nice one. Bye-bye.
[05:11] [Receptionist]: Thank you, ma'am. Bye-bye.
