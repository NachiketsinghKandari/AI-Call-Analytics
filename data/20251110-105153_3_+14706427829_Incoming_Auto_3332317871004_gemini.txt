----------------------------------------

[00:03] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling Bain and Associates, this is Dennis speaking.
[00:05] [Ashanti Lewis]: Hi, good day to you. Um, I was calling because um, I was involved in a car wreck with my daughter and my two nephews on Halloween. I signed some papers, um, I signed some papers for um, Bain and Associates to take my case and um, I'm sorry. And um, my- me and my daughter we are getting ready to start our chiropractor treatment but I was trying to see when I signed it I didn't see my daughter's name on there and um, when I was getting ready to start um, go to the chiropractor and everything they- my daughter needed the referral or needed to be added on as well. And um, also my sister children were in the back seat so they're trying to work- sign the contract and it's just not the same as mine.
[00:58] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me take a look and see who started and who did this one for you. May I have your first and last name please?
[01:11] [Ashanti Lewis]: Yes, Ashanti Lewis. A-S-H-A-N-T-I Lewis. L-E-W-I-S.
[01:21] [Receptionist]: All right, Ms. Ashanti Lewis. Yes. Let me go through... um... [ ... Silence (13s) ... ] So basically you're looking to see about the contract and HIPAA for the- for the children that were in the back seat?
[01:43] [Ashanti Lewis]: Correct. And um, if my daughter- I signed mine and I was trying to see if my daughter was included with me. I didn't see her name on it. And um, my sister just called and she was sent one but hers doesn't match mine. I guess her fee is um, 33% to 40 or 40 and mine is 28 or 40. And I just thought it would be the same.
[02:09] [Receptionist]: Okay. [ ... Silence (29s) ... ] Now, Ashanti, was this- were you- did you speak by any chance to a representative from Bain and Associates or was this from the Hurt 911 team?
[02:49] [Ashanti Lewis]: Um, I got my... um, I'm sorry. My contract is from Bain and Associates. I haven't signed anything with anyone else. I've had a lot of people calling. I'm sorry.
[03:15] [Receptionist]: When did you speak with the representative?
[03:21] [Ashanti Lewis]: I'm sorry?
[03:22] [Receptionist]: When did you speak to the person that gave you the contract?
[03:26] [Ashanti Lewis]: It was someone from Piedmont, um, the hospital. They gave me um, the referral and then um, I believe I spoke with somebody from the office because they called me and um, that's how they got my number and they texted me the DocuSign and I signed my contract.
[03:48] [Receptionist]: Okay, so while you were at the hospital someone- someone referred you?
[03:54] [Ashanti Lewis]: No, while I was- no, I was out of the hospital. They called me to check on me and help- and said they could help get an attorney so I took their help.
[04:01] [Receptionist]: [ ... Silence (10s) ... ] Okay, let me put you on a brief hold and see who was handling this, okay?
[04:18] [Ashanti Lewis]: Okay, thank you.
[04:21] [Receptionist]: Thank you, ma'am. No problem.
[04:23] [Ashanti Lewis]: Okay.
