----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, how may I help you?
[00:04] [Megan Newball]: Yes, hi. This is Megan Newball calling from Liberty Mutual Claims and I was calling because I just received your letter of representation for Benjamin Sadler.
[00:12] [Receptionist]: Okay, one moment.
[00:13] [ ... Silence (18s) ... ]
[00:31] [Receptionist]: Okay, I've got that file, how may I help you?
[00:38] [Megan Newball]: Um, I needed a couple of things if you don't mind. First, um, how do you want me to get the deck page? Can I email it or what do you want me to put it in the mail?
[00:44] [Receptionist]: Sure. You can email it to me, I'll throw it in the file, no problem.
[00:47] [Megan Newball]: All right, what's your email?
[00:49] [Receptionist]: Just my first name, Matt, M-A-T-T, at beyandassociates.com, spelled all the way out.
[00:58] [Megan Newball]: Perfect. I will send that as soon as we get off the phone. Um, second, I wanted to confirm injuries and treatment as I don't have that information on file yet.
[01:06] [Receptionist]: Okay, one sec.
[01:08] [ ... Silence (11s) ... ]
[01:19] [Receptionist]: So it doesn't look like he went to the hospital. Uh, he's been uh treating at Arrowhead Chiropractic is what it looks like where he's started.
[01:29] [Megan Newball]: Okay. Um, do you know what he's complaining of?
[01:33] [Receptionist]: One second.
[01:35] [ ... Silence (10s) ... ]
[01:45] [Receptionist]: Uh, back pain, neck pain, and looks like kidney, kidney pain, but part of his back pain. From that wreck, um, so I don't know if he's got some bruising on his—
[02:00] [Megan Newball]: Got it, okay.
[02:01] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I don't have any image of like injury images, but I'm just looking at the pictures of the vehicles, I mean, it was a T-bone.
[02:12] [Megan Newball]: Yeah, that was my next question as I'm pretty sure I got liability wrapped up, I just don't have his version, so I just wanted to confirm what happened basically.
[02:25] [Receptionist]: Um...
[02:26] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[02:32] [Receptionist]: I think uh he basically he was driving straight, I guess uh another vehicle tried to turn uh left uh across in front of him, I think maybe somebody else waved him in that was stopped or whatever. Um, but basically he was just driving straight and uh the other person turned, turned in front of him.
[02:53] [Megan Newball]: Okay. That's what I thought. Okay. Um, can I— did he say anything about the traffic at the time or just that the other vehicle appeared to have waved the the left-turning vehicle on?
[03:04] [Receptionist]: I think that's, yeah, we don't have the police report yet, but that's uh that's, yeah, similar—
[03:11] [Megan Newball]: Yeah, I don't have it either. I haven't ordered it, I haven't—
[03:13] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I mean, he was driving straight and—
[03:15] [Megan Newball]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, that would— I absolutely, I got liability wrapped up, I just wanted to confirm that my question on the liability was not about your client but the waiver. Do we have any information on the waiver?
[03:26] [Receptionist]: Oh, I don't know. No. No.
[03:30] [Megan Newball]: Okay. No. Um, and I don't even know, I mean, it doesn't seem like it matters, but I don't even know how that really plays out because you still have your own duty, right?
[03:37] [Megan Newball]: Yeah, oh absolutely, and I'm like, I've not seen a whole lot of these in Georgia, but I do know other states if you can identify the waiver, there is liability on the waiver. I'm just not a hundred percent sure on Georgia. Like obviously your client—
[03:51] [Receptionist]: I've never seen it that way. I mean, uh, I've been doing this, you know, it sounds like you've been doing it a while too, I've been doing this over a decade.
[03:58] [Megan Newball]: Yeah, same. About 12, no, 13 years for me.
[04:01] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I'm like right there with you. So, you know, I've done, you know, we do a decent amount of volume. But anyway, yeah, I mean, like generally I haven't seen that uh play factor. But either way, what um can you verbally give me the limits?
[04:10] [Megan Newball]: Yes, absolutely. Okay. Um, and I'll get that deck page over to you shortly. It is... I gotta... I got a 25.
[04:17] [Receptionist]: 25/50? Okay.
[04:19] [Megan Newball]: Yeah.
[04:20] [Receptionist]: All right, appreciate it.
[04:21] [Megan Newball]: All right, I'll forward that um deck page and then I'm I'm updating liability like I said, your client didn't do anything wrong, I just wanted to find out if anybody knew the waiver information, but no, so that would mean we are liable. So I will get that updated.
[04:35] [Receptionist]: Okay, sure.
[04:36] [Megan Newball]: Um, and then if you do by chance get photos of his injuries, if you could forward them to me, um, so that way I have them and I kind of know what we're dealing with, um, so that it's easier once y'all are ready for a demand or what have you.
[04:50] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I'll— we haven't assigned— it's still in the intake process, so once it get assigned— gets assigned to the— to one of our case managers, I'll— I'll ask them to forward those to you.
[05:01] [Megan Newball]: I appreciate you. Did you need anything else from me before I let you go?
[05:05] [Receptionist]: No, I think we're good. Uh, so you are accepting liability or what?
[05:08] [Megan Newball]: Oh yeah, yeah, I was looking at it, but my only question was just if we could find the waiver, um, but obviously, yeah, we we have the greater duty. I mean, your client did nothing wrong, he's minding his own business. It is what it is.
[05:21] [Receptionist]: Okay, sure.
[05:22] [Megan Newball]: So, yeah, I'll get that updated, so no no issues there. And then, um, I usually follow up every two to three months or so while we're in the treatment phase, if that works for you, or do you have a different preference?
[05:31] [Receptionist]: No, that's perfect. That'll work.
[05:33] [Megan Newball]: Excellent. Well, I appreciate you. You have a lovely holiday.
[05:36] [Receptionist]: You too, yes ma'am. Thank you.
[05:38] [Megan Newball]: Thank you. Bye.
[05:39] [Receptionist]: Bye-bye.
