I called last week, um, to get the application started for a loan because I'm very behind on everything. They have not started my workers' comp money, nothing. Um, I'm in the process of getting evicted, my truck is in the shop, like I need the loan and they steady constantly telling me they gonna call me back, but they haven't updated me after doing the application for the loan. So what is the name of the loan people so I can call them and see what's going on, or see if I have to just go with a different firm all in all, 'cause this is ridiculous.
