----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Jesse]: Hello, thank you for calling Bay and Associates Law Firm, this is Jesse, how can I assist you?
[00:07] [Shayna Celaya]: Hi Jesse, my name is Shay and uh I actually got called by Fatima earlier today uh regarding a fall that I had at a grocery store on November 2nd.
[00:22] [Jesse]: Understood. All right. Uh so you are one of our clients, yeah?
[00:26] [Shayna Celaya]: I mean, I am ready to lawyer up if they're not going to pony up and help me pay for my injury, yeah.
[00:33] [Jesse]: Understood, all right. Perfect. Let me help you with this. Uh can you provide me your name so I can search for your information?
[00:42] [Shayna Celaya]: Yeah, it's Shayna, S-H-A-Y-N-A, last name is Celaya, that's C as in cat, E as in Edward, L, A, Y, A.
[00:53] [Jesse]: Perfect. Give me one moment ma'am.
[00:55] [Shayna Celaya]: I'm sorry, I'm driving right now so I apologize if I'm kind of yelling, you know.
[01:01] [Jesse]: No worries.
[01:02] [ ... Silence (16s) ... ]
[01:19] [Jesse]: Understood. My apologies. And let me ask you ma'am, did you already sign a retainer with us?
[01:23] [Shayna Celaya]: Nah.
[01:25] [Jesse]: Understood. Got it. All right. So uh...
[01:31] [Shayna Celaya]: It's literally like I contacted y'all and they said oh they texted me and said do you have any photos and I'm like all I have is like the the form that I filled out on the day of the incident. I don't have the video of the the incident. Uh I do have the emails that their representative or whoever is supposed to be like investigating, like I've got those emails but he hasn't he hasn't contacted me back other than the two emails, one of them saying hey I'm the person and then the second one was like kind of their procedure of like oh well if we're not liable we're not loyal essentially you know like okay well you're doing an internal investigation you guys were at fault for this. So.
[02:02] [Jesse]: Got it, got it, got it understood all right. So let me tell you what we would need to do would be to complete your intake process, we would need to gather some information. Let me ask, is there a police report of this incident?
[02:17] [Shayna Celaya]: No, there's no police report. I didn't think there would have to be. Because I tripped I tripped over a piece of metal that was on the bottom of a shelf in a grocery store that should have been attached to the shelf but it came free and because my foot got caught on it it caused my footing to come out from underneath me and I slipped and fell.
[02:54] [Jesse]: Got it, got it, got it. I'm really sorry to hear that ma'am.
[02:58] [Shayna Celaya]: So I mean I just don't think that's something that you would call the police over, you know what I mean?
[03:02] [Jesse]: Right, right, I do understand.
[03:05] [Shayna Celaya]: But yeah but they definitely are responsible because they knew that it was faulty, they even said oh it happens all the time that that thing comes off of the shelf but they haven't fixed it and so it's a hazard. And luckily for me I just tweaked my back a bit but I have had to go to the chiropractor, I've had to go get injections to help with the pain. For someone else this could have been a broken hip, you know.
[03:30] [Jesse]: Right, right, right. I totally understand. All right. I do get it ma'am. All right. Let me help with this. Uh do you allow me to place you on a brief hold for one minute? Uh we might have to do an intake process but uh let me first make a profile, all right?
[03:45] [Shayna Celaya]: You don't have my profile there?
[03:48] [Jesse]: Uh it looks like that we don't. I did search for your name...
[03:52] [Shayna Celaya]: Can you spell my name back to me? Not that...
[03:54] [Jesse]: Uh yes ma'am. So it would be it would be S as in Sam, H, A, Y, N as in Nancy, A and your last name would be C as in Charlie, E, L as in Lima, A as in Alpha, Y, A as in Alpha, right?
[04:13] [Shayna Celaya]: You guys don't even have an intake for me? Seriously?
[04:16] [Jesse]: I haven't found one ma'am. But let me do a little bit of uh let me do a little bit of deeper research and uh allow me to get back to you in one minute ma'am, all right?
[04:27] [Shayna Celaya]: Okay.
[04:28] [Jesse]: I'll be right back with you real quick.
[04:30] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[04:37] [Jesse]: All right. And thank you so much for holding ma'am.
[04:40] [Shayna Celaya]: Yes.
[04:41] [Jesse]: Uh let me tell you so unfortunately I cannot find any information regarding your file on my system. Uh would it be possible...
[04:46] [Shayna Celaya]: That's so wild. Do you want me to tell you the person who was handling it who emailed me?
[04:54] [Jesse]: Uh yes what's his name or her name?
[04:57] [Shayna Celaya]: Let's see, let me just take a look really quickly.
[04:59] [Jesse]: Yes ma'am.
[05:00] [Shayna Celaya]: I know I got an email. Or maybe it was a text message. Give me one sec okay I'm just taking a look. Because that's just wild to me that they wouldn't have already written something because again I got this reminder from them. They were like oh hey can you like send us info. Oh Pamela M with Bay and Associates. Is this Bay and Associates?
[05:22] [Jesse]: Uh yes this is Bay and Associates.
[05:25] [Shayna Celaya]: Okay Pamela M said thank you for taking a moment to speak with me on on November 6th in regards to your legal matter, please provide us with photos and documentation pertaining to your case so we can further evaluate. Upon receipt we'll be able to call you as soon as possible, thank you. And then she sent that again to me on Monday because the initial one was back last Friday that they they texted me that. Unfortunately I'm a teacher and usually the hours that you guys would call me are during my work hours because I work from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM so it's just one of those things, you know.
[06:00] [Jesse]: Got it, got it. Understood. Let me tell you ma'am, so this is what we can do. Would it be possible for you to give us a call back tomorrow at at your best convenience whenever you have the time so we can double check your information? Uh there is currently no one in the office that can help me at this moment but we can try to do a deeper search.
[06:15] [Shayna Celaya]: Well what are y'all's hours? I'll do so but I mean the thing is is that like this isn't going to work if we're just playing phone tag so uh y'all need to figure stuff out. I realize you're probably just an after hours clerk, right?
[06:36] [Jesse]: Right, right, uh I'm deeply sorry ma'am. Uh I'm one of the intake persons.
[06:39] [Shayna Celaya]: All right then don't worry about it okay I'll call them back I'll try to catch them during work hours but again it's just inconvenient because I am a teacher so like I get like a half hour at the beginning of my day and I get a half hour at the end of my day when I try to like get stuff done but yeah we'll see. All right thanks anyway. Bye.
[06:57] [Jesse]: Thank you so much ma'am.
