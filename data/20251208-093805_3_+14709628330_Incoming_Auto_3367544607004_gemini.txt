[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Tasha, how may I help you?
[00:08] [Skylar Shockley]: Hey, how you doing, Tasha? Um, my name— I'm sorry. My name is, um, Skylar Shockley. I was a customer with you guys. I recently just got my check from you guys, um, and the guy stated to me that you guys bank with Bank of America. So I was trying to see, 'cause I was here getting the check cashed, but I don't have— well, first I tried to deposit the check into my banking account, and I have Chime, so I'm guessing that that wasn't— it wouldn't work. So I came up here to you guys' issuing bank, and they was telling me that they couldn't give me, I guess, cash for the check. So how do I go about this?
[00:53] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, that would be with your case manager, ma'am. Your case manager's name is Paige Allman. You said your name is Skylar Shockley, is that correct?
[01:06] [Skylar Shockley]: Yes.
[01:08] [Receptionist]: And the date of the accident was on May the 19th of this year?
[01:13] [Skylar Shockley]: Yes, ma'am.
[01:15] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, I can transfer you over to your case manager, ma'am. She would be the best person to speak to regarding this issue.
[01:22] [Skylar Shockley]: Okay, thank you.
[01:24] [Receptionist]: You're welcome.
[01:25] [ ... Silence (11s) ... ]
[01:36] [Receptionist]: One sec. Um, transferring now, ma'am.
