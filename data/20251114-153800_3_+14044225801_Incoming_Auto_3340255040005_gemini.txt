[00:05] [Leah]: Yes hi, um my name is Leah. I just had a quick question. Um I just wanted to see who I can speak with about if I need a lawyer or not for well I mean for my mom. She is 66 years old and she was driving about a month ago and then got into not a not a bad accident but like a kind of like a minor accident with a school with a school APS bus. Um and then they said and then they said and then they gave her the ticket saying that she was at fault for it. So we thought that she was going to pay for the ticket and that's it but they were saying that oh she would have to appear to court because due that it's with the APS school bus.
[00:51] [Receptionist]: Given the fact that she does have a ticket she would definitely need to first appear in court and dispute the ticket-
[00:57] [Leah]: I'm sorry I cannot understand you properly. I don't know if it's the background or or what.
[01:06] [Receptionist]: Can you hear me clearly now?
[01:09] [Leah]: No, you sound like you're far away. I don't know.
[01:15] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I do apologize about that but yes, uh she would need to appear in court first and appeal for the ticket before any attorney can assist her. Was she injured?
[01:28] [Leah]: I- oh it's so bad. My goodness. I cannot hear nothing.
[01:35] [ ... Silence (17s) ... ]
[01:52] [Receptionist]: Give me a second let me call you back.
[01:55] [Leah]: Okay.
[01:57] [Receptionist]: All right.
[01:58] [Leah]: Okay.
