[00:11] [Receptionist]: I'm doing good, thanks for asking. How about you?
[00:14] [Sharlee]: Oh, I'm doing well too. Thank you so much for asking. Um, actually, I was, uh, just calling today in regards to attaining, like, case status updates for a few of our clients. Um, I was calling in regards to an—

[00:32] [Sharlee]: Uh, yes, actually just in regards to that, um, actually we have a list of maybe, let me just check, like 70 or so clients that we require status updates on, and I had sent like an email out, um, to Michael at BeyandAssociates.com, and he informed me that basically, like, he would be unavailable until probably the mid of, um, January or so to provide me with the case status updates. So, I was just calling to see is, is there any better way I can, um, get those status updates earlier because I need to have those records closed on my end as well.
[01:14] [Receptionist]: Sure. Okay, I'm going to give you the email. Uh, she's like the lady in charge of all the records and everything. I'm the secondary, and Michael is away. But I'm going to leave the email, you can forward the email to her. Okay? Actually, I'm going to give you two.

[02:22] [Sharlee]: Understood. Okay, so the first, I got the second email, Brittany at BeyandAssociates.com. Um, but for the first email, you said that's B, then a, like B as in Bravo, H as in Hotel, E as in Echo, C as in Charlie, K as in Kilo, A as in Alpha, B as in Bravo, O as in Oscar, N as in November?

[03:37] [Receptionist]: Oh, they actually answer really fast the email, but I mean, they can just reply an acknowledgment, but you can ask her, okay? You just need to let her know, "Please, I need those documents for my records as soon as possible." That's it. Just leave your message. Mm-hm.

So besides that, do you guys need me to add anything else as well, or just that?
