Um, and I explained to Ms. Cindy earlier, the lady I talked to, um, that the email that I basically was receiving from you guys, I'm no longer able to get into that email and so I asked Ms. Cindy earlier took my new email down and tried to reach out to Ms. Megan, um, Hicks, um, to see if they could reach out to me to let me know my deposition date and I guess like what I need to do to prepare for that, um, but I have yet to hear anything from anybody and I just want to make sure that I the message is getting across to them because I've had this issue with Bey and Associates for a while now that you guys don't reach out to me and kind of connect the dots. So I'm just trying to make sure and follow up with you guys.
[01:27] [Receptionist]: Okay, give me one moment please.
