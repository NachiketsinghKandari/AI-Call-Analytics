[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Kareem, how can I help you?
[00:04] [Mildred]: Hey, this is Mildred with Team Rehab. I am calling about Cassandra Molina.
[00:12] [Receptionist]: Give me a moment, let me check on that.
[00:15] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[00:21] [Receptionist]: Cassandra Molina?
[00:23] [Mildred]: Yes, that's right.
[00:25] [ ... Silence (6s) ... ]
[00:31] [Receptionist]: All right, and what exactly do you need to know about this case?
[00:34] [Mildred]: Yeah, um, on this one, we were doing a reduction negotiation and we kind of stopped, uh, let's see, I think the last message was in November, no, it was December, December 8th. Um, on this one, I was wanting to know if we could wrap up at 1900.
[00:56] [Receptionist]: Um, let me try to get the, uh, the case manager, maybe she's available. Hold on one moment, okay? And you said your name is?
[01:03] [Mildred]: Mildred.

[01:08] [Mildred]: Thanks.
[01:14] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for holding.
[01:16] [Mildred]: Yeah.
[01:17] [Receptionist]: Um, none of the case managers are available today, uh, due to the holidays. I apologize for that. It's going to be very hard to get ahold of them. Um, I will, if you want, I can transfer you to their voicemail and then they can get back to you on Monday.
[01:34] [Mildred]: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you so much.
[01:37] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. Give me one second, okay? Thank you.
[01:41] [Mildred]: Okay.
