----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Main and Associates Law Firm. My name is Fatima. How may I assist you today?
[00:07] [Nina]: Oh yes, I was calling. My name is Nina. I'm with State Farm. I was calling because we received a demand from you guys, but um, I'm thinking you guys were trying to send it to someone else or to another claim because it does not belong with the claim that it was sent to.
[00:23] [Receptionist]: Oh, um, may I please have the client on whose name it is so I can contact the case manager?
[00:31] [Nina]: Okay, yes, let me get that pulled up here. I'm trying to go back. Uh, first name is Danielle and last name is McCray, M-C-C-R-A-Y.
[00:43] [Receptionist]: Thank you. Bear with me while I pull up their file.
[00:48] [Nina]: Okay.
[00:52] [Receptionist]: Does it have the um, case manager's name by any chance?
[00:55] [Nina]: It does not. Let me see if it's at the end of this demand.
[01:02] [Receptionist]: And Danielle, it's spelled D as in dog, A, N as in Nancy, I-E-L?
[01:10] [Nina]: Uh, let's see how they have it spelled in here. Okay. Let me get back to the first page. It looks like it's spelled, um, D-A-N-I-E-L-L-E.
[01:27] [Receptionist]: All right, thank you. Because nothing was coming up for me the way I had it.
[01:32] [Nina]: Gotcha.
[01:34] [Receptionist]: Okay. Danielle. Can you please let me know the date of loss?
[01:47] [Nina]: Um, let me find the police report because there's like no cover letter or anything with this. Oh. Yeah, yeah, there's nothing. It just came in when all it is is medical bills and um...
[02:01] [Receptionist]: Maybe it was a trainee.
[02:03] [Nina]: Gotcha. And hopefully this didn't come from another attorney and they sent it to your claim, but um, it's September the 2nd, 2024.
[02:20] [Receptionist]: Thank you. Because with that name, let me take a look at archive file because nothing is coming up with Danielle McCray. So I will make sure, since I know I have the name spelled correctly, let me go ahead and spell the last name. I have M-C-C-R-A-Y.
[02:43] [Nina]: Yes, that's correct.
[02:45] [Receptionist]: Okay, so nothing is coming up on my system with the name Danielle McCray.
[02:57] [Nina]: Well, I'll put a note here. Well, I'm not sure who sent this demand, but they sent it to your claim, so um, it's like...
[03:12] [Receptionist]: I mean, I have a different McCray, but nothing with that Danielle. I have Taylor or I have Regina McCray. I have different names, but nothing with Danielle McCray.
[03:26] [Nina]: Gotcha. Yeah, well, I'm going to definitely put a note in here to let them know that this is definitely not the claim and it's not one of your clients either. I'm not sure who, like I said, the attorney is then because like there's no cover page or anything, just a whole demand with like 300 pages came in.
[03:41] [Receptionist]: Oh my god.
[03:52] [Nina]: Yes, and I'm pretty sure whoever sent that definitely wants it in the right place. So I'm just going to put a note and maybe see if I can find them.
[04:02] [Receptionist]: Thank you, but my heart goes out to all of you guys, adjusters, because we are having, I mean, I know you guys receive like two over 200 cases and now that we are having winter and there's more cases, it's like oh my god.
[04:12] [Nina]: Exactly. Exactly. But it's about to get crazy. Oh yes, I'm thinking I should go back to my career. I said I was a mental health counselor and I'm about to start counseling myself.
[04:40] [Receptionist]: That does not make it better.
[04:45] [Nina]: Exactly. I was like, I don't know what I was thinking switching careers.
[05:00] [Receptionist]: But that's even better though, like oh my god, you guys, healthcare providers, you guys are the best. Like I could never put an injection on anyone, I would just pass out and die.
[05:17] [Nina]: You guys are the best.
[05:19] [Receptionist]: Oh my god, you're the best. So if I come across anything or any demand, then for sure I will let the case manager know, but so far I don't have a client with that name. At least it's not coming up on our system.
[05:37] [Nina]: Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, I'll try to send this to the people who sent this out, maybe they can find them.
[05:44] [Receptionist]: Right.
[05:46] [Nina]: But thank you so much for your assistance.
[05:48] [Receptionist]: Oh, you're so welcome. Have an amazing rest of the day. Bye-bye.
[05:53] [Nina]: You too. Bye. Thank you.
