[00:37] [Dionel Lopez]: Okay, what is the name of the client?
[00:40] [Kambria Hardnett]: Kambria Hardnett.
[00:44] [Dionel Lopez]: You said Ambria?
[00:46] [Kambria Hardnett]: Kambria, C-A-M-B-R-I-A. I've called twice already and someone was supposed to call me back, the person, I still have not gotten or received a call from you guys. My patient already received her check. I need to know what's the hold up. I need my money.
[01:07] [Dionel Lopez]: I'm sorry, um, you said, um, the first name is C-A-M-B-R...
[01:14] [Kambria Hardnett]: No, that's not what I said. K-A-M-B-R-I-A. Hardnett, H-A-R-D-E-N-T-T.
[01:29] [Dionel Lopez]: One moment.
[01:31] [ ... Silence (63s) ... ]
[02:34] [Dionel Lopez]: Um, based on what I have seen here, we are still preparing checks to send them out, so we have not sent...
[02:42] [Kambria Hardnett]: I'm confused. So how did my patient get her check?
[02:46] [Dionel Lopez]: Well, she's the client, so of course she would get that...
[02:49] [Kambria Hardnett]: No, no, I've been doing this for a while and I'm also married to an attorney. We both do personal injury. When you do disbursement, you cut everybody check at one time.
[03:00] [Dionel Lopez]: Unfortunately, I don't have that answer.
[03:03] [Kambria Hardnett]: Can you transfer me to somebody who does?
[03:06] [Dionel Lopez]: Let me check one moment.
[03:12] [Dionel Lopez]: Thank you so much for holding. The person in charge of the check is not available right now, but you can speak to...
[03:18] [Kambria Hardnett]: Is there an attorney that's available? Who is the man who's in charge? No attorney's available?
[03:22] [Dionel Lopez]: Tara Chapman is in charge of the checks.
[03:25] [Kambria Hardnett]: No, no, I need to speak to an attorney because when I report y'all to the bar...
[03:28] [Dionel Lopez]: All the attorneys are not available, I'm sorry.
[03:31] [Kambria Hardnett]: There's no attorney that's available? Because, what's your name? Because when I report you to the bar, I need him to know who was responsible for it. What's your name?
