----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Matt]: Bay and Associates, Matt speaking, how may I help you?
[00:04] [Sierra Shaw]: Hi, is Matt...
[00:06] [Matt]: Yeah.
[00:07] [Sierra Shaw]: Hi Matt, this is Sierra Shaw, how you doing?
[00:11] [Matt]: Hey Sierra, what's going on?
[00:12] [Sierra Shaw]: Um, is Jonathan available?
[00:14] [Matt]: Um, let me see if he is. It's... Did you have, is it a question I can answer? You just trying to touch base?
[00:21] [Sierra Shaw]: Um, maybe so. I don't necessarily have a question, just a follow-up. Um, I wanted to let him know that we did get the police report amended, um, and we now have two different cases as opposed to one.
[00:37] [Matt]: Okay.
[00:38] [Sierra Shaw]: So I would need to share the new police report.
[00:41] [Matt]: Yeah, you want to email it to him and to me? Um, I can give you his email and we'll... Yeah.
[00:46] [Sierra Shaw]: What's your email first?
[00:47] [Matt]: Mine's just my first name, so just Matt at and then the firm's spelled all the way out, bayandassociates.com.
[00:56] [Sierra Shaw]: The word "and" spelled out?
[00:57] [Matt]: Yep. Yes ma'am.
[00:58] [Sierra Shaw]: Okay cool.
[00:59] [Matt]: And then Jonathan's is jsteele@bayandassociates and his last name is S as in Sam, T-E-E-L-E, so jsteele@bayandassociates.com. And I'll make a note that you're looking to touch base with him.
[01:18] [Sierra Shaw]: Okay, and then my next question is, um, not this past weekend, so let me give you the right date. So this past Friday would have been the 31st and the following... so the 24th of October I asked, um, just for my records and I've been pretty consistent in asking all of the doctors for just documentation for my records of cost and everything. Um, however, with is it AICA? A-I-C-A?
[01:46] [Matt]: Okay.
[01:47] [Sierra Shaw]: With AICA, they sent me a certified letter in the mail on the 25th, um, saying that if I don't pay the charges in less than 10 days or in 10 days they will put a lien on my credit. And then they did it again this past Friday. So at this point, because the case is still going on, um, my mother did receive...
[02:04] [Matt]: Let's talk about that. It's not a lien on your credit. They they file a lien against the case, but it's going to get paid out of the settlement when you're done.
[02:13] [Sierra Shaw]: Yeah, but I just thought that was so weird because they didn't send it to my mom. It was just exactly after I asked them about documentation.
[02:21] [Matt]: They are, um, they they do a good job, but they send that letter out and they never explain what that letter means to their patients, which we get this call not all the time, but obviously I've gotten this call before from folks. So because they're basically providing the treatment at zero cost upfront, they file that lien to make sure that when we get you your settlement, you they their bill gets addressed. But it's not against your credit. It's not a credit lien, it's just against the case.
[02:53] [Sierra Shaw]: Okay, okay. Um, okay, I just wanted that clarity and more understanding because I'm like, okay, what is going on here? Um, and like I said, it would be different if both of us received it, but because we're both on the case and only one person, I was like, this is crazy. Um, yeah, no, makes sense.
[03:11] [Matt]: And they're going to work with us on reductions, so we're not going to pay their bill in full when, you know what I mean? We're going to get those bills down, you know, they'll they'll be very amenable to what you need based off of how much we can recover from the other party.
[03:26] [Sierra Shaw]: Okay. And then I have one more comment, um, which is my experience. I don't know if this needs to be noted on the file or not, but so we went to the police report, we as in my mother and I, both went to the police precinct on Friday to get the case amended. We were able to talk to the officer that was on call as well as, um, the sergeant that was on call or on duty that day at the precinct. However, it's the... it seems like there's some speculation or it just seems a little fishy of what's going on in terms of how the original police report was written out. And then after the police report was amended, or when we were pleading our case of why it needed to be amended, how pro the officer was to the person that hit everyone as opposed to me being at... the person that got hit, if that makes sense.
[04:19] [Matt]: Yeah, because you were the front car in the three-car... they the original report has it as a three-car collision, right?
[04:25] [Sierra Shaw]: Correct, correct. And so we shared, we pled our case on why it was the truck driver, um, that hit us as opposed to, um, the car that originally in the diagram states the sedan isn't the car that hit us. And so, um, we have to get a report from open records, which is at the main precinct in DeKalb County, their headquarters, to receive information on the truck driver or the truck pickup truck that left the scene. He received a DUI also. Um, so we needed to get that that full report so that we could send it as well and we found that out from the sergeant at the East precinct. Um, however, the sergeant was diplomatic and understanding of how this definitely how there was no way that the sedan that hit the pickup truck, um, could have hit us just based off of the marks on my car, um, all of the data and stuff that we shared with them. Um, but I think it's important to note how, I don't know, it's just something fishy going on regarding how pro-choice the and I don't know if pro-choice is the best word to use, um, but how pro the officer was to the sedan, which was the last car that hit the truck in three-car pileup. Um, and now on the police report it's going to say that it was a hit and run, not that the truck fled the scene and that it was a hit and run, that there had to have been theory-wise, there had to have been someone that hit the sedan, um, to impact that three-car pileup.
[05:59] [Matt]: Mhm.
[06:00] [Sierra Shaw]: However, there's no evidence to state that there was another driver that hit him, um, and it's all speculation. And then also one of the questions that the sergeant asked was how do we know that he got hit in the accident? Could that have been previous, um, damages to his vehicle? Um, and because he lied the first time stating the location in which his car was when the accident occurred, could he have lied and said that he got hit in the back as well? Um, so those were comments that were stated. I did, I was able, um, to record the state the conversation, um, just for my own records as the officer recorded for his as well. Um, so I do have that documented, documented, excuse me. But it's just something that I was just like, something intuition is not giving me the green light about this officer and I want to make sure that, um, you all are aware as just he was just very concerned, more concerned about him as opposed to the justice of the entire case.
[07:11] [Matt]: Yeah, no, for sure. I would just, um, summarize that in the email to Jonathan. Yeah, and when you send over the report that you're the amended report, the officer's it's tough because, you know, I think it depends on where everything lands. If we end up having to litigate, then we can subpoena the officer into a deposition, um, and kind of drill down on that. If if we're able to get all the correct insurance carriers to take responsibility, then it may not be needed. Um, it's a little weird because the officers show up after the fact. They don't witness the event. Right. Um, they're really supposed to be, you know, a neutral party and and they you know, they're looking at what they see, they take they're supposed to take statements from everybody, but they're not really supposed to go much beyond that, but sometimes they do. I don't know why they do that, but...
[08:05] [Sierra Shaw]: Yeah, that's something that was very clear, um, and if I can upload the conversation, I'll just just to have everything in the file. Um, that was something that I was very clear on and the sergeant was like, okay, we just we weren't there. Um, and he made it very clear. He's like, so we're taking our theory based off of the evidence that we've seen and also the statements. And because we already have one statement that was false, it, um, kind of nullifies the witness of, you know, anything further since you he already came in the gate lying about where he was, what happened during the accident. So, um, and if the officer the person in the pickup truck received a DUI, that we can't credit that statement according to them, they're saying that they can't credit his statement because he was intoxicated. So I was like, at this point, you're only the only statement that you have are myself and my mother. Um, so it's just very interesting to see and interesting is not a word to describe the feeling or the interaction that we had, but it definitely raised my antenna to say, hmm, there's more to this. I just can't put my finger on it right now. However, I will summarize that information in the email and, um, hopefully the report is available. Um, do you want me to just send the ticket picture or do you want me to get the send you on the report?
[09:39] [Matt]: If you have the report already, then yeah, we'll take your copy. If we need to get it from BuyCrash, we can, and that's not a problem. Um, and then, you know, what I will tell you big picture is there's sort of two things with a case like this that are playing out. There's the potential criminal component, which we, you know, with what's going to happen with the DUI and all that, we can follow that and see sort of if the person ends up like pleading guilty or getting prosecuted. Um, so we can follow up on that. Our main goal is though to get all of the potential insurance policies available to you to pay up regardless of what happens to the DUI component. You know what I mean? Right. You know what I mean? Like, there's you so we're going to follow that, we're going to if the prosecutor picks it up and asks us for any information we have, we're going to cooperate with them and try to push that through, but at the same time our goal is to make sure you get compensated.
[10:39] [Sierra Shaw]: Right, absolutely, absolutely. Um, what I will do now that I'm thinking about it, let me, um, because I wasn't able to on Friday, let me get the open reports or open records from, um, the DeKalb County precinct, their headquarters first, and because they'll have all of the information, um, of, you know, things that they could not place in the police report, general police report. So, um, what I can do...
[11:09] [Matt]: And we're happy to check that stuff down too, like if if needed, so you just let let uh when you email Jonathan let him know what you have or what you plan to get and what we need to get because we we can request it online. It takes a little longer, but they'll send it to us. We can purchase like documents, anything that's uh any of that open record request stuff we have the ability to get. It's just an online process for us.
[11:33] [Sierra Shaw]: Right, right. Um, okay, perfect. And then I'm going to share everything that I got in the last few days. I was able to talk to the fire department, um, because prior to getting the case amended, one of the big hiccups was, you know, what was the placement of the cars, um, at the scene of the incident. And so I was able to get a report from the fire department because one of the things that they shared was typically when they're on the scene, um, they would be noted in the police report. Um, and so because they weren't, I was like, okay, that's these are key things that are not added in here, um, that is causing red flags. So I did get their report. However, they also it it wasn't like a thorough report as a police report would be. They just stated that they were there at the scene. Um, they do have camera footage of course that they can um that can be subpoenaed to review in terms of the placement of the cars and the damages and things of that nature. Um, there's one more thing. But they also have their witnesses there who were there that night as well.
[12:48] [Matt]: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, so yeah, and in kind of like how far we need to go with all that has a lot to do with like do the proper insurance companies take responsibility? Because if they do, then it doesn't make sense for us to waste the money going after because that all comes out of your case, right? Right. Um, so if we have to do that to get where we need to get, of course we will, but if if they're able to basically provide coverage as needed, then...
[13:21] [Sierra Shaw]: Then it won't be an issue.
[13:23] [Matt]: Well, yeah, we won't want to waste the time and the money because, you know, there's always limited funds and we want to use those funds for your medical treatment and for your pain and suffering as much as possible.
[13:34] [Sierra Shaw]: Right. Absolutely. And that's that was my thing. I think, um, prior to Friday, the biggest thing was we have no way, um, because I think the police officer that I did speak with, um, after trying to just track down which precinct the officer was at, um, because it's been like almost a two-week process trying to get this amended. Um, one of the police officers was like, okay, well this sounds like a lie. Um, I can't state how truthful this testament or this narrative is that you're wanting to be amended. So I was like, okay. All right, if we're going that route then let me cover my behind and start contacting people who were there. Um, in the meantime. However, by Friday of last week we did get it amended, um, or spoke with them. And so now I'm like, okay, let me check this amended thing because I just don't trust that you're on the up and up. So, so yeah, I will I'll email both of you all, share those details and then, um, go from there.
[14:41] [Matt]: How much longer do you think you have of treatment? Is that going everything's moving along?
[14:46] [Sierra Shaw]: Um, well, we put a pause last week only because we were like, let's amend the report before going back to, um, treatment. Um, and I told them, I was I was very vocal in sharing like I had some other doctor's appointments that I needed to attend to prior um prior to booking an appointment. So this week we're going to, um, continue appointments and then, um, ask, you know, timeline-wise how many more treatments do we have, um, so...
[15:19] [Matt]: Yeah, that's pretty much it. Okay, perfect. Sounds good. Well, you know, appreciate the update. Like I said, um, Jonathan's working from home today, but I'm sure he'll respond to your email once he gets it.
[15:31] [Sierra Shaw]: Okay, absolutely. Thanks so much, Matt. Talk to you soon.
[15:34] [Matt]: Yeah, talk to you soon. All right. Thanks, Sierra. Bye-bye.
[15:36] [Sierra Shaw]: Bye.
