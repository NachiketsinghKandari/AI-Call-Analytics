[03:31] [Christopher Lamorte]: I think from Google.

[03:34] [ ... Silence (13s) ... ]

[03:48] [Daniel]: Okay, so I was discussing with your wife yesterday. Well, it was not yesterday, but she was letting me know that you started with the Suboxone around 2021.
[03:59] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yes.
[04:01] [Daniel]: Okay. Okay, give me one moment please.
[04:13] [Daniel]: Okay, do you have maybe around like an specific date or month of 2021?
[04:21] [Christy]: I think it was August.
[04:23] [Christopher Lamorte]: Uh August.
[04:25] [Daniel]: Okay, August of 2021.
[04:27] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yes.
[04:29] [Daniel]: Okay. And she was saying that you were um taking like a combination of um film and tablets?
[04:35] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yeah, but it was pretty much film the the entire time. I think I'd only tried tablets once um and then it was pretty much film the entire time. Okay. Uh until I um up until the point where I switched to um Sublocade, which was the injectable form, but that was like uh well actually I was taking them both at the same time for a little bit longer. I want to say it was about a year after I started taking it at least.
[05:12] [Daniel]: Okay. And can you give me like a brief description of how or, you know, what was the reason that you started using Suboxone?
[05:20] [Christopher Lamorte]: So it was actually because I was taking an herb that is legal, so it's I wasn't doing any illegal drugs. Um but it's called Kratom and um so I had had a dependence on that and I was told that Suboxone would be the best way to help me get off of it. Um and uh so I switched in August and then I never went back after that. Um but yeah, I started having issues.
[05:52] [Daniel]: Okay. And what was the specific date where you started um you know feeling symptoms that something was going wrong?
[06:00] [Christopher Lamorte]: Um wrong like in like sorry hold on, like wrong as in like with um with my teeth stuff specifically?
[06:11] [Daniel]: Yes.
[06:12] [Christopher Lamorte]: Or uh do you have those records? I would say like I want to say it was probably 2023, but I I didn't make the connection uh at first. Um but we probably I we should have the health records. Um it was basically when they told me before I had only needed a couple crowns and that's all I had and then basically um I went to get a checkup and they told me all of my front teeth needed uh to be replaced by crowns and it was out of nowhere. I had never even had cavities in my front teeth. But I want to say that that was like uh about 2023 when I found out about it.
[06:47] [Daniel]: Okay. And what were um like the um can you give me like a description of all the um situation that, you know, maybe um everything that you have feel so far about your teeth?
[07:09] [Christy]: Oh gosh, it's been a lot.
[07:11] [Christopher Lamorte]: I'm sorry, what was the question?
[07:24] [Daniel]: Yes, I would like to know like if you can give me um like a description of um all the symptoms that you are having in your teeth like all the illness or yeah.
[07:32] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yeah, I mean there's been um infections in my back teeth, so I had a lot of cracks, which was really weird because there's no reason for me to have any cracks. Like that's why I needed crowns in my front teeth is because I just had random cracks uh that wasn't even from cavities or lack of care they said, it was literally just cracks in my teeth. Um there was uh gum recession, that was a big one.
[07:51] [Christy]: Root canal, root canal.
[07:53] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yeah, like I suddenly started needing like I went from literally needing only one or two crowns or something like that to suddenly now like having multiple root canals and then um like six to twelve crowns needed. Um and yeah, and then I've had infections um and uh just a lot of pain. Like like she might have mentioned, like I just spent the last few days out of commission and had to go to an emergency dental uh person because I had another tooth infection.
[08:20] [Daniel]: Okay. So I'm going to be asking um some questions and if applicable you can say yes or no. Um so cavities?
[08:28] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yes.
[08:30] [Daniel]: Okay. And what about tooth decay?
[08:33] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yes.
[08:35] [Daniel]: Okay. Um rotting teeth?
[08:37] [Christopher Lamorte]: Uh rotting teeth? Um I don't think so. Oh yes. My wife is saying yes.
[08:48] [Daniel]: Okay. What about tooth loss?
[08:52] [Christopher Lamorte]: Uh a tooth loss? I mean...
[08:57] [Christy]: You almost had to lose it.
[08:58] [Christopher Lamorte]: Uh not yet, but I I may have to. We're we're trying other things first.
[09:00] [Daniel]: Okay. What about needing dentures?
[09:05] [Christopher Lamorte]: Uh dentures no, not yet.
[09:12] [Daniel]: Okay, what about root canal?
[09:15] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yes, several.
[09:18] [Daniel]: And oral infections?
[09:21] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yes.
[09:23] [Daniel]: Okay. Okay, and you told me that most of the time you were using films only and tablets just like one or two times?
[09:32] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yeah, so uh I was when I first was on it, I was having some nausea related symptoms and so basically we had tried a few other options like the tablets to see if that would work if that would help me, but it didn't and so insurance covered the the film so that's what I stayed on.
[09:53] [Daniel]: Okay. Okay, and what about okay let me see.
[10:05] [Daniel]: So are you still using that Suboxone or you stop that already?
[10:10] [Christopher Lamorte]: So I've stopped it. I'm on the monthly injection called Sublocade now, um which is from the it's still from Indivior um but uh I actually have not gotten an injection in about three months so I'm on my way off of it basically.
[10:28] [Daniel]: Okay. And what was do you remember where you um stopped taking those um Suboxone?
[10:37] [Christopher Lamorte]: Uh like when I stopped stopped taking Suboxone completely? Like the the strips?
[10:44] [Christy]: I believe it must have been September of this year.
[10:46] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yeah, it was it was about August or September of this year.
[10:53] [Daniel]: Okay, so it was recently.
[10:56] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yes.
[10:58] [Daniel]: Okay.
[11:02] [Christopher Lamorte]: Yeah, once I realized that uh like I I didn't really make the connection because I had a lot of other health issues and so once I realized that I uh was done with it.
[11:14] [Daniel]: Okay. Okay, so these were basically all the questions that we had so far. The intake has been complete. So based on the qualified questions we um might be able to assist you with your case. So um I'm going to be sending you a contract for you to sign through VineSign and then a paralegal will be reaching out to you to discuss the case further by Monday or Tuesday, okay?

So I will be asking you to gather some information like every doctor um who prescribed you Suboxone or clinics um and the, you know, that you list me all the dental issues.
