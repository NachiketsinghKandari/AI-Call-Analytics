[00:13] [Receptionist]: Yes ma'am, this is Bain and Associates law firm.
[00:16] [Shalea Hayes]: Yes, some- somebody had- they was supposed to be representing me and I was supposed to be with the lawyer before I signed the documentation. Nobody has called me back yet to see anything and they had me going to like the- the therapy, the chiropractor and stuff. So I need to see what's going on, so is there anyone I can speak with?
[00:37] [Receptionist]: Can I have your name, ma'am?

[00:43] [ ... Silence (17s) ... ]
[01:01] [Receptionist]: When was the last time you spoke to someone, ma'am?
[01:04] [Shalea Hayes]: They called me on the 26th and the 27th and the 28th, like every day they was calling me. And somebody called me and sent me a whole app- they emailed me a um contract and all that to sign, but I haven't- they was supposed to have the lawyer to call me back, nobody has called me back yet.
[01:27] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[01:37] [Receptionist]: Ms. Hayes, I'm having trouble locating your file, unfortunately, but let me see here, let me try this one.
[01:43] [Shalea Hayes]: I don't have a file, I'm a brand new person. They was- I haven't signed anything yet. They said they was gonna have the lawyer to call me before I signed any documentation, so you're not gonna see anything for me.
[01:54] [Receptionist]: Oh, okay. Um, do you remember who you spoke to, Ms. Hayes?
[01:59] [Shalea Hayes]: It was a couple of names. I had just came from the hospital, so I don't know. But they have me going to see a- a chiropractor, Ika, so I wanted to- they already had started sending me there, so I wanted to um speak with somebody about the- the lawyer, they was supposed to have the lawyer to contact me back. So is the lawyer not available?
[02:26] [Receptionist]: I can try to see- we have several lawyers here, Ms. Hayes.
[02:33] [Shalea Hayes]: Right, so who would be representing? Like they was supposed to tell me who would be representing me.
[02:38] [Receptionist]: Okay, um, but I- I can't transfer you- I have to have some record of you. Who- do you remember who sent you the contract, ma'am?
[02:47] [Shalea Hayes]: Um, hold on for a second, I just...
[02:53] [Receptionist]: Uh, okay.
[02:55] [Receptionist]: I see it here.
[02:58] [Shalea Hayes]: It was on the 27th at 12:35.
[03:01] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[03:03] [Receptionist]: I do, I do, unfortunately, I do.
[03:06] [Shalea Hayes]: Yeah, so how somebody gonna represent me? I'm coming in and I don't even know who it is.
[03:14] [Receptionist]: Exactly. Um, we have several attorneys here, Mrs. Hayes. Once you've signed, we will- the company will assign an attorney to your case, but I can get in- try to reach out to another attorney here if- if that's what you'd like, to speak to someone.
[03:27] [Shalea Hayes]: Yeah, I don't want nobody just to sign my case, I want to know who representing me because I'm paying them. Yeah, okay.
[03:35] [Receptionist]: One moment, just a second here. Let me try one of the attorneys. Um, his name is Jonathan Steele. Let's see if he's available. I'm not sure if he's in court today or not, ma'am. One second.
[03:42] [Shalea Hayes]: You let me know, please.
[03:45] [ ... Silence (5s) ... ]
[03:51] [Receptionist]: Ms. Hayes?
[03:53] [Shalea Hayes]: Yes, I'm here.
[03:54] [Receptionist]: Um, yes, unfortunately, the attorney's not available at this moment. He's on the other line with another potential client, but I have left him a message and I have arranged for him to give you a call back later on today. Do you have a specific hour that I can arrange that- that call, ma'am?
[04:08] [Shalea Hayes]: No, just have some- they was been supposed to call me back, it's delaying my case. So, yeah, it's delaying my stuff. I needed to speak to somebody, I don't know who represent nothing. But okay.
[04:26] [Receptionist]: Um, I'm going to make that my priority today, Mrs. Hayes, to get you in contact.
[04:29] [Shalea Hayes]: Cause they had done start sending me to the chiropractor and all that stuff.
