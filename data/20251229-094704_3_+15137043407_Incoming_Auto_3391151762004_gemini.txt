[01:23] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I mean, but we're— I'm an intake specialist, and you know, um, I wouldn't be able to provide any kind of update, but uh, I don't know.

[ ... Silence (15s) ... ]

[01:55] [Receptionist]: Yes, thank you so much for patiently waiting, Ms. Cheney. Yes, they're not in the office. Uh, what I do see on your case right now is they're currently in negotiations with insurances right now, so they're working on your case. But to, you know, keep in mind that that takes time. Uh, if you want more information in regards of it, you're going to have to wait until next week.
[02:09] [Niesha Cheney]: So you saying they waiting on my insurance, you said?
[02:14] [Receptionist]: No, they're currently negotiating with them, I believe that is the process they have right now. Um, but it takes time, so if you want more details about it, you're going to have to call back until next week.
[02:25] [Niesha Cheney]: Okay, okay, okay. I understand, okay. That I'm not worried about, the process of what— what I'm calling is concerned about, uh, basically, um, I don't have the car insurance, I'm try— I'm— I'm in the process of— of changing car insurance, of— so basically, do— okay, what my question is, let me get to the point. Okay, I don't have my car insurance no more. So is that going to interfere with my— my case right now?
[02:56] [Receptionist]: I don't believe so. I mean, if I say insurance, I believe medical insurance right now. Uh, I'm not sure if they're currently working on the other— on your car insurance. That's going to have to be discussed with Lonnie, but that's until next week.
[03:12] [Niesha Cheney]: Yeah, 'cause I'm just basically just need— 'cause right about now I'm in a situation, I don't— I'm about to change— I'm— I'm just wondering though if— if I drop my car insurance right now today, will that interfere with what I have going on today for— as my— my injuries.
[03:35] [Receptionist]: Right, I wouldn't be able to answer that, ma'am. If you want, you— I can give you Lonnie's email address, you can send her an email, maybe she can respond later on today.
[03:46] [Niesha Cheney]: Oh, her. Yeah, 'cause I'm in a situation about my— my car insurance and like I said, I— I was insured at the time, but I'm about to in a situation that I'm about to get rid of this car insurance that I have. And I'm just wondering if I drop it right now today, would it interfere with what I got going on, even though we already that process— that process has already been gone, the pro— we already went through the process. But I'm just saying, you know, I'm just trying to be on the safe side. You understand what I'm saying?
[04:18] [Receptionist]: Right, I do, hon, but you know, I wouldn't be able to answer that since I'm not an attorney, so I don't know what their process would be. So, um, if you want, you can send her an email. Do you have Lonnie's email?
