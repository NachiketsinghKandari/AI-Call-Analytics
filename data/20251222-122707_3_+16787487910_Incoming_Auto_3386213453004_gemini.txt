----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Hello, this is Angelo from Bey and Associates, may I help you?
[00:06] [Cedric Jackson]: Hey, how you doing? Um, I was calling because, um, I had you guys set up, um, a loan for me, um, through Preferred Capital Funding, and, um, that was two weeks ago, and I called them this week and they was letting me know that they needed y'all to send something over or to contact them to make the process move a little faster. I don't know, but, um, it's been two weeks since I asked for it and they keep telling me the same thing that it's in review or, um, it's getting ready to be finalized, but then today she told me that she need to speak with someone from the firm or y'all need to send something over, so I don't know what's going on. So I was just calling to see if you guys could contact them and see what's going on.
[00:50] [Receptionist]: And what is the name for the client?
[00:53] [Cedric Jackson]: Yes, my name is Cedric Jackson.
[00:57] [Receptionist]: Okay, and Cedric, one minute. It is your case, now that you are asking?
[01:05] [Cedric Jackson]: Yes ma'am. I mean, yes sir. Excuse me.
[01:07] [Receptionist]: No worries. Let me go ahead and check if the case manager is available because the case manager is the best point of contact in this situation. Stay on the line, give me one minute.
[01:21] [Cedric Jackson]: Okay.
[01:22] [ ... Silence (10s) ... ]
[01:32] [Receptionist]: Thank you for staying on the line. So I was making the verification and it looks like that the case manager, which is Dante, who's the one who is taking your case at this moment, he is unavailable at— so far. Would you like to leave him as a voicemail? Just to see if he can call you back?
[01:50] [Cedric Jackson]: Um, no, when do— is he out of the office today? Is he just— he's just not picking up right now?
[02:01] [Receptionist]: Eh, no, it is not at this moment. I can see here that he tried to contact on December 4th, but you didn't answer and so he left a voicemail. But if you wish, you can leave a voicemail and he can call you back.
[02:16] [Cedric Jackson]: He said— he said he tried to contact me on the 4th? I talked— I conversated with him on the 11th. So we had— we had a conversation around the 11th of December. I don't know why it's saying missed phone call, but yeah, I'll just call back later, um, and try to catch him back.
[02:34] [Receptionist]: Later, yes. No worries. Anything else for us, though?
[02:42] [Cedric Jackson]: No, thank you.
[02:44] [Receptionist]: All right.
