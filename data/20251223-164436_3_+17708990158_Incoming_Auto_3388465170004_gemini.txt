  • [Karen Lowe] / Karen Lowe / Role: Caller: 28 turns

----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling Bey and Associates. My name is Jesse. How can I assist you?
[00:06] [Karen Lowe]: Yes. My name is Karen and I was doing some internet searches for mold attorneys.
[00:14] [Receptionist]: All right. And um, were you involved in an incident?
[00:18] [Karen Lowe]: Well, my daughter has been living in a townhouse for two and a half years. And within that two and a half year period, now the mold has came out black and came out of the vents, exceeding to the ceilings. The tub has mold in it. All the appliances that have caused the leaks were not fixed. Understood. We sent a demand letter asking for everything to be fixed, including the mold. Still have no response. All they want is $2,200. Like I told her, I'll pay the court the original $1,600, not paying no late fees. I had to take the grandbaby to the hospital this morning because she keeps— she has her pediatrician she has been seeing since her mother's born. Okay. You kind of see what I'm saying? So we've had this doctor in our family for the last 30 years.
[01:25] [Receptionist]: Right, right. I understand.
[01:27] [Karen Lowe]: So the doctor has— the doctor has seen the mom because that's where I took my daughter. Now the grandkids go to the same doctor. Got it. So the baby keeps on breaking out, like skin rashes, all of a sudden. She woke up with a skin rash this morning and upper respiratory problems. My daughter had to take her to the pediatrician. The pediatrician wrote an extensive unhealthy letter for them to be in that house because she even showed her a picture of the vent. So the doctor said, "What are they doing about it?" My daughter said, "Nothing." She said, "Are they trying to move you somewhere?" She said, "No. We can't get nobody to respond." Somebody was supposed to call us Sunday and uh Monday and ain't nobody called her.
[02:22] [Receptionist]: Understood. Let me ask you, you mentioned that she lives in a house, right?
[02:26] [Karen Lowe]: The house— it's a apartment. Got it. It's a townhouse.
[02:33] [Receptionist]: Got it. And since when has this problem been presenting, ma'am?
[02:38] [Karen Lowe]: Well, let me kind of say this. Two days after we moved in, we had a air conditioner leak, but we didn't know it was the air conditioner that was leaking. So they fixed that. Then there was a tub leak. And I guess they so-called fixed that, but they didn't come down because it protruded to— it made water stains in the kitchen. Because I'd ask my daughter, I'd sit up there, I said, "What's that?" "Leak." "Oh, the tub was leaking." She said they said they fixed it. I was like, "Oh, okay." Well, now there's two holes that was cut in the ceiling in the kitchen. All right. One's got a cardboard box over it that they never came back and fixed. And the other one, they didn't pull the sheetrock out, they just cut the hole, but they still didn't put putty around the parts that they— because so that part could fall out if it wanted to. Then you go to the tub, and you know how you spray paint your tub to get it all nice and pretty? Well, with the water damage, the tub bubbled. So that meant all the paint came off. And where the paint came off now has black going all around it. Oh, understood. That's at the bottom of the tub. Understood.
[04:05] [Receptionist]: Understood. So and let me ask you, when did you notice this problem, ma'am, approximately, you know?
[04:11] [Karen Lowe]: I would say August the 1st of last year. That's when it started really getting bad. Got it. Got it. Understood.
[04:18] [Receptionist]: Got it. Got it. Understood. August the 1st of last year. All right. Got it. And let me ask you, did you— you mentioned did you already notify your landlord about—?
[04:27] [Karen Lowe]: The last notification— okay, every time an appliance was broke, I notified them. Got it. And then they would tell me they gotta order the part. Two, three weeks go by. I call them back and say, "What happened?" Just they even did me like this with my stove. I said, "What happened?" "Oh, we waiting on the part." Well, they had the part all along. The guy said, "Well, the part's over there in the shed." You mean to tell me I had to go buy a little portable stove and wait two weeks to find out that the part was in the shed? Got it.
[05:01] [Receptionist]: Got it.
[05:02] [Karen Lowe]: So yes, each time each appliance was broke. So the last appliance that broke was about two months ago, was the ice maker in the refrigerator. Got it. I didn't know that, but it's water's running everywhere. So I've got towels, which is not that far, which is probably 10 feet, if you put two feet in front of you, probably 10 steps from the very first water leak. So it's all still in that same area. Got it. You know what he did? When when I called main— maintenance to find out where the water leak is coming from, that one went— I started cussing. He looked around and said, "Oh, it's coming from your ice maker." He unplugged it and left. He didn't wipe up no water, he didn't bring no fan, he didn't do nothing. He said, "I gotta order—" he said, this is what he said. He unplugged it. He said, um, "Most of our refrigerators don't have ice makers." Okay, so? "So I'm gonna have to order the part." He always says that. "I gotta order the part." Got it. So we waited for about a week. We look up, they have closed the work order out and says completed. Got it.
[06:24] [Receptionist]: Got it. I'm deeply sorry about that.
[06:27] [Karen Lowe]: Okay, so we let that go. So we've been doing some research because we've been trying to contact the code enforcement for the city of Marietta ever since the 10th of December for someone to come check the quality. So the doctor told me to go take a— the letter states today that the conditions of the apartment is affecting um my daughter's immune system. Got it.
[07:01] [Receptionist]: Got it. Got it. Got it. Your daughter and her children, right?
[07:04] [Karen Lowe]: Huh?
[07:05] [Receptionist]: Your daughter and her children.
[07:07] [Karen Lowe]: Correct. Correct. My daughter has as— even though she has asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, the air quality in the house, the dog, one dog even coughs all the time. My grandson, because if the houses here are made with all the vents in the ceiling versus the floor. Understood. So when you're washing dishes at the sink, the vent's right there in your face, coming straight to your face as you're washing the dishes. My granddaughter broke out when she laid on the couch. And this is not her first breakout. So it's affecting her skin. Because you know how a little kid come in and come and plop on the couch after school, lay their books out and stuff? Yeah. So I told my daughter, "Take the couch covers off and throw a sheet over it." So the couch is contaminated. Um, the dishwasher no longer works. So what we did, um, because of our research with everybody says you have to notify them one more time. So we did on the 20th of this month. We sent a final demand letter basically stating, uh, "This is Kendria Hawkins. Uh, like she said, um, I'm writing this letter in the request of my work orders not being completed and the extensive mold in my house. Can someone come down and, you know, check it out and do something about it?" Right, right. Understood. The the property— the so-called property manager, she called back. She's— because she's mad because my daughter won't give her $2,200. Rent's only $1,600. Got it.
[09:11] [Receptionist]: Got it. Got it. So why— why does she want the the extra 600? Because she fixed something?
[09:19] [Karen Lowe]: No, no. She said she did put them on there for fees because I won't give her the 1,600. She put them all— all them is late fees and stuff. Got it. So then I told my daughter, "No, I want to go to court." So she served my daughter with an eviction. Now we've been there for three years. But this is the funny thing. This is the funny thing. Um, you're in Georgia, right?
[09:43] [Receptionist]: Yeah.
[09:44] [Karen Lowe]: Okay. Uh, I don't know if you're familiar with Marietta, but this is— we're right on the 120 loop. We're at Roswell Road where the 120 loop kind of crosses us. And then you go underneath the bridge and Kroger's up the street on Robinson Road. It's called East Lake Shopping Center. Got it.
[10:08] [Receptionist]: Got it.
[10:09] [Karen Lowe]: Okay. So in that complex, it's called Arbor at East Cobb. In that complex, they got flats and townhouses. Well, my daughter lives in the townhouses. In that row of two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath townhouses, they've got five of them, A through F. Well, when you come down the stairs and venture a little off to the left is A and B. As soon as you come down the little five steps, you got apartment C. And then you got to the right, D, E, and F. Well, the kids that lived in apartment C, I guess their mama didn't want to pay the rent, college kids, they moved. So all the townhouses are exactly the same. Exactly the same. Apartment D moved out and moved into apartment C. Got it. All of a sudden, this has just been in the last three weeks. So when we sent the letter on the 20th, the manager, uh, Anquanita, she's the property manager. Right. She she calls my— because now she's looking at the letter, the demand letter about the mold and not fixing the appliances. You know what she told my daughter? "I'm going out of—" she sent her email about 8:00— 8:00 PM on Sunday night. Because see, she mess— what she does is she doesn't like to do anything during business hours, this lady. Got it.
[11:51] [Receptionist]: Got it.
[11:52] [Karen Lowe]: And my daughter said, "If the rent's due on the 4th, this property manager start calling you on the 1st to remind you that your rent's due." Got it. But on the 19th, what she— I mean on the 21st of this month, she told my daughter, she said, uh, after she looked at the letter, the demand letter about the mold, "I'm going out of town." Now wait a minute. All while we talk to you, we talk to you the 17th, the 18th, and the 19th when you was asking about the rent. So my daughter said, "I'm just gonna put her off because she got the rent." She said, "I'll pay you on the 24th. I'll pay you next Wednesday." Normally my daughter pays like a day late. You know, if rent's due on the 4th, by the 5th it's paid. You might— she might pay a $70 or $80 late fee, but it's paid. So when my daughter said she wasn't gonna pay rent till the 24th and then the lady's looking at the demand letter, she went out of town. She so-called says she's going out of town and somebody else is going to handle the situation. Some lady named Jessica was going to handle the situation. We have not heard from Jessica. First of all, we didn't even know who Jessica was. Like my daughter says she has met everybody in the last two and a half years. She's never heard of Jessica. So Monday we're sitting around and I'm I'm waiting. I said, calling my daughter, "Anybody call you?" "No." She said, "I tried, but they won't answer. Won't even pick up." So her number's blocked. So what I did is I called the office on my phone from a different number. Caitlin answered. So I said, "Hey, Caitlin. How you doing? Do you have any three-bedrooms?" I just act like a renter. "You have any three-bedrooms for rent?" She's like, "No." She says, "Well, we do have a three-bedroom flat." I said, "What, somebody's above me?" She said, "Yeah." I said, "No, I don't want that because I got kids and they probably do too and I don't want to hear their noise over mine." Right, right. So plus I got dogs and I want the townhouse. "Oh, we won't have any available till March." I said, "Okay." But that's on the other side of the complex. See, when you— we come in the complex, I'm on the right side. So the other townhouses must be on the left side of the building. So she said, "We won't have any till March." I was like, "Wow, okay." So that means they have nowhere to put my daughter. Right, right.
[14:21] [Receptionist]: Right, right.
[14:23] [Karen Lowe]: So then I said, um, I came back and I said, "Caitlin," I said, "is anybody in the office?" She's like, "No, just me." I said, "Okay." I said, "I'm gonna ask you some questions." I said, "Don't be alarmed." I said, "You don't want to be involved in— don't ask, just listen to what I'm gonna say because you don't— I don't want to get you involved in this." I said, "Who is Jasmine?" Or no, I told her, "Who is Jes—?" Yeah. She said, um, "She's a leasing agent like me." I said, "Oh, okay." I said, "So who is Quanika?" She's the property manager. I said, "Okay." I said, "So are they there today?" She said, "Yes, Amina's there." I said, "Oh, she is? Want me go get her?" "No." I said, "Nope. Do not go get her." I said, "Do you have a copy of the lease there?" Because she didn't even want to give— the church was even gonna help my daughter. Got it. So she wouldn't have to pay all the late fees. My daughter had to ask, and this was around the 9th or the 10th, my daughter had to ask them three times for a copy of her new lease. You know, because you can do everything online now. The lady didn't want to give it to her. So that's what held up the church money. Understood. Because she keeps on taking— she keeps on taking off of work to take the kids or herself to the doctor. Last week they pulled black stuff out of my daughter's neck. She's already had nose surgery this year for living in that apartment. We have all documentation of doctor visits.
[16:03] [Receptionist]: All right. Got it. Got it. All right. So let me tell you what we're going to do. Okay. So I understand the issue, ma'am. I'm deeply sorry about this whole situation, but we might be able to assist. Uh, I just have to ask you a few questions and I'll send this information for uh review with one of our attorneys. Um, okay. So first of all, you would like to file a claim against the uh the complex, right?
[16:27] [Karen Lowe]: Right. Because first of all, they will not come fix nothing. They got her in an un— no, they knowingly have her in unhealthy living conditions per the pediatrician because we showed her a copy of the vent. And there's seven vents in the house and every last one of the white vents are black. Understood.
[16:51] [Receptionist]: Understood. All right. And uh okay. So what is your name, ma'am?
[16:55] [Karen Lowe]: My name is Karen. I'm the mom. My last name is Lowe, L-O-W-E. I'm the grandma. Got it.
[17:04] [Receptionist]: Got it. Got it. All right. Perfect. And what is your daughter's name?
[17:08] [Karen Lowe]: My daughter's name, and I'm gonna spell it, is Kendria, K-E-N-D-R-I-A. Her last— her last— her last name is Hawkins, H-A-W-K-I-N-S. Perfect.
[17:24] [Receptionist]: Perfect. And uh how many children does she have?
[17:28] [Karen Lowe]: She has three. Three.
[17:29] [Receptionist]: Three. And all of them have health issues?
[17:32] [Karen Lowe]: Yes. The very first— my grandson, 17— well, he will be 17 years old. He couldn't even go to school on the first day because he was deathly sick. Got it. Got it. She had to stay home for the first three days. He had a severe— she had to take him to the doctor too. She had a— he had a temperature of 100 and something. He had uh couldn't eat, couldn't do nothing. Nose and head because he's laying in the bed and he's close to the kitchen where the very first leak started. He ain't that far from where the bathroom upstairs is. He ain't that far from the refrigerator. Got it. Got it. All right. See, because his bedroom— his bedroom, you know if you have a two-bedroom townhouse, you know where the dining room's really right there by the kitchen. Right, right.
[18:23] [Receptionist]: Right, right.
[18:24] [Karen Lowe]: But we got doors. So we made his bedroom the dining room. Got it. So um on one opening, if he goes out of one opening, he right there by the laundry room and then he's right into the pantry and then there's the kitchen. So he can lay in his bed and see you sitting at the kitchen table. Got it. But every vent in the house, there's nowhere that you could put the bed because like I said, if you're washing dishes, the vent's right there and it would be blowing in your face. So as he's laying in the bed, the vent is blowing down towards his face because that's the only wall that you could kind of like put the bed on. And that's the way it is in every room. Got it. Got it. Understood. And because there's a creek— because there's a creek back behind the house, there's no sunlight and it's moisture back there. Everything's always stays damp all year round. Got it.
[19:24] [Karen Lowe]: So the back of the townhouses never gets sunlight. Never.
[19:29] [Receptionist]: And let me ask you, ma'am, you mentioned that he's the 17-year-old. Is he the oldest one of them?
[19:34] [Karen Lowe]: Yes.
[19:35] [Receptionist]: How old are the other two?
[19:37] [Karen Lowe]: The next one uh you might as well say on January the 5th, she'll be 15. Got it. And she's got weird growths. We had to take her out of public school. We have went to rheumatologists, we have went to everybody. Got it. Because all of a sudden she was walking and she's her leg just gave out on her. And then all of a sudden like a uh maybe the size of a uh a plum, this knot grew. Understood. Like, you know most of your socks go past your ankle, right? Right, right.
[20:15] [Karen Lowe]: Right above that, she grew a plum-sized knot that gave her nothing but pain. She couldn't even walk. She— you know how many times— you know most kids, they're excited about going to high school? She made it two days in high— she made it because it was too much to walk and carry her books. Got it. So we had to take her out and homeschool her because we didn't know where this first of all this lump came from. Guess where the lump is now? On her arm. Oh my god. It is no longer— like I said, because her mom has arthritis. So we went through seeing if this is a new stage of arthritis. The arthritis doctor said no. So now the lump is on her arm, messing with her hand, and like she said, her arm hurts. It done jumped from her leg to her arm. That's the 15-year-old. Understood.
[21:16] [Receptionist]: Understood. And how old is the youngest one?
[21:19] [Karen Lowe]: The youngest one will turn six on January the 30th. Understood. All right. Oh, she went to the doctor today. She went to the doctor today because she woke up this morning, her body had broke out again, like a red rash. Got it. And she's wheezing, coughing, sneezing, and you could like just all clogged up. Upper— like so the doctor put on there, her pediatrician put on there, she is a— and I haven't seen the letter. My daughter was reading it to me. But it states that the baby has upper respiratory problems uh and some other health issues because my daughter showed her the picture due to the conditions of the house. And then she put it some other things in there. And then she also told my daughter, "I'm going to do some more research." She said, "Because this is unhealthy." And she wanted my daughter to know, "Are what are they doing to help you? Are they plan on moving you, whatever?" So Dr. Lorette Ho that is in Sandy Plains Pediatric, uh I guess it's Marietta, but uh she is now involved. Got it.
[22:39] [Receptionist]: Got it. All right. All right. Let me ask you—
[22:42] [Karen Lowe]: Go ahead.
[22:43] [Receptionist]: I just wanted to ask you, I was talking to somebody else and they we found out they only had one star. How many stars you guys got?
[22:51] [Receptionist]: How many stars? I can— I can answer that. Give me one moment. Let me see here. Well, we got four and a half stars, ma'am, in Google reviews.
[22:59] [Karen Lowe]: Yeah, that's what I had to say. That's my daughter— see what I do is I find the people and she goes back and looks at their review. And this was Hega, H-A-G— H-E-G-A. And they only had like one star. So we stopped talking to them. Got it. And I decided to get back on the phone and do another Google search for an attorney because we got the doctor's note. She told me I had to get a air quality test and a lab report. Understood. But I got the doctor's information basically stating the apartment building is killing my granddaughter. So do I still need that?
[23:42] [Receptionist]: Well, let me tell you what I what I would need to do, ma'am. Now, and thank you so much for sharing all the information and sharing your story. I'm deeply sorry about this whole situation you and the kids are going through. Um, let me tell you what we need to do. So I would need to send this information over for review. I already have most of the details regarding the issue. So I just need to send it for review with one of our attorneys so that they can provide me uh with better insight whether we can help or not. And then I will get back to you, ma'am, with an answer, all right?
[24:11] [Karen Lowe]: Okay. You know, I know you guys don't do this, but and I know it's a very busy time of the year, other time— you know what? If you had a just a email just to let them know how serious my mold is and if they want to take the case or pursue it, I would love to just send you a picture of the vent.
[24:32] [Receptionist]: That's actually what I wanted to ask you, ma'am. Um, I will actually for— let me tell you, so—
[24:37] [Karen Lowe]: Can I send it in a text message? Send it in a text message to our email.
[24:41] [Receptionist]: Uh yes, ma'am. Let me ask you, so is it possible that you can send me medical records and the reports you made to the landlord via email?
[24:50] [Karen Lowe]: Uh yeah. Uh let me ask you, let me ask you this. See, because okay, you said you had four stars, right?
[24:58] [Receptionist]: Yes, four and a half.
[25:01] [Karen Lowe]: Okay. And she's gonna love that. She's gonna love that because she looks at reviews.
[25:08] [Receptionist]: Perfect. You can check our reviews and check uh what everyone what our clients have said about us. Uh she'll be very satisfied with what she will see.
[25:17] [Karen Lowe]: And this is John Bey, right?
[25:19] [Receptionist]: Well, my name is not John Bey. My name is Jesse Gonzalez. I'm from the intake department, but this is Bey and Associates, ma'am. I work with John— John Bey.
[25:26] [Karen Lowe]: Yeah, I just want to— yeah, I just want to make sure because I was doing Google. I just want to make sure I did get called the right place, Bey and Associates. Right, right. Yes, you did.
[25:36] [Receptionist]: Uh yes, you did. Yes, you did call the right place, ma'am. All right. So let me ask you, this would be the best phone number to reach you, 770-899-0158?
[25:46] [Karen Lowe]: Correct. You want my email?
[25:49] [Receptionist]: Yes, please. Can you provide me your email?
[25:51] [Karen Lowe]: All lowercase. It's karenlowe532@gmail.com.
[26:04] [Receptionist]: gmail.com. Understood. Perfect. All right. So let me tell you what I'm going to do. Uh I'm going to send you an email, ma'am, where I'm going to state that your case is being reviewed. And I'm going to send your information over to our attorney, Jonathan Steel, so he can review the case. You will get back to me and then I will get back to you with an answer, ma'am. Hopefully we'll get a positive answer so we can go ahead and sign the contracts and continue with the process, ma'am.
[26:26] [Karen Lowe]: Okay. Now let me just ask you this because this, you know, is there a fee? Because anything coming out of it would be coming out of my pocket, not her.
[26:34] [Receptionist]: Well, let me tell you, it's actually a contingency contract. What this means is that you do not have to pay anything unless we win the case for you. Okay. So in case we do not win or or there is an issue with that, we'll let you know right away and there will be no fees for the job done if there is any job done at that moment, ma'am. But it is a contingency-based contract.
[26:59] [Karen Lowe]: Okay. Okay. I mean, that's fine. You know, I just I'm tired of my grandkids since her dad, her sister came from Canton and looked at the wall and said, "Ugh, what is that?" She said, "You gotta get out of here." She said, "Don't pay that lady no rent." My thing was like I told my daughter, "I'll pay the court, but I won't pay her." Right, right.
