----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Carrie speaking. How can I help you?
[00:05] [Tarika Mitchell]: Um, hi Carrie. Um, it's Stephanie and I'm trying to talk to someone, um, about my case. I'm trying to see if they got all the medical and stuff in because I'm ready to get this process on the road.
[00:16] [Receptionist]: Okay. Uh, can I have your name now?
[00:19] [Tarika Mitchell]: Tarika Mitchell.
[00:21] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[00:30] [Receptionist]: Tarika, Tarika Mitchell?
[00:33] [Tarika Mitchell]: Mhm.
[00:34] [ ... Silence (20s) ... ]
[00:54] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me get you the case manager, alright? Bear with me.
[00:58] [Tarika Mitchell]: Okay. Sounds good.
[01:00] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for patiently waiting, Ms. Mitchell. Right now, Stephanie, which is the case manager, is in another call. Would you like her voicemail?
[01:10] [Tarika Mitchell]: Um, no. I'm so tired of voicemail. I need to really see where this case is going. Um, I need to see what documents they need and see if there's a way I can physically go get them, um, for them because I need those demand letters sent out as soon as possible. This case was already won before I even gave them the case. They had already accepted fault. There is no reason why I'm still sitting around not doing treatment and no letters been sent out yet. So I need to know as soon as possible what are they waiting for so that I can try to help them get it. And I need it this week.
[01:41] [Receptionist]: I understand. Yes. And she is the only one that can provide that information, but, you know, if you— if you want, I can try and see if she's available. She was in another call.
[01:51] [Tarika Mitchell]: Okay. Is there anybody else over her or...
[01:54] [Receptionist]: No, she is the one handling it, so she's the only person that can give you the information besides the attorney. The attorney's not in.
[02:00] [Tarika Mitchell]: But Matt— yeah, Matt usually gets them to call. I might have to call him again because this is ridiculous. I need this done.
[02:08] [Receptionist]: Right, I understand. I will let her know that you called and that you need that information, okay? So that she can reach to you. Is there anything else?
[02:16] [Tarika Mitchell]: Also, is there anyone that can look at my file outside of her to see what's going on with it?
[02:21] [Receptionist]: I can look at your file, Ms. Mitchell. The thing is that I cannot tell you exactly what is— what is needed because I'm not an attorney or I'm not a case manager.
[02:31] [Tarika Mitchell]: Okay. Can you see if any demand letters have been sent out yet? Because that's what I've been waiting on.
[02:37] [Receptionist]: There's no way I can tell you because I don't want to give you inaccurate information, to be honest with you.
[02:42] [Tarika Mitchell]: It wouldn't be inaccurate if you're looking in the notes. This not my first rodeo. That's when I'm noticing that this is very, very slothful business and it's not even making sense at this point.
[02:58] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me see.
[03:00] [ ... Silence (8s) ... ]
[03:08] [Tarika Mitchell]: This is a different— not a call. So I can't talk to— I need to talk to somebody. No, this not Glenda Mitchell. I should have went back to them. This would have been done. But no, I was— I was convinced to go somewhere I didn't want to go.
