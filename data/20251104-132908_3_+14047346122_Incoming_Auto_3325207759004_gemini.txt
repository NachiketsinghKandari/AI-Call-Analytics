[00:00] [Fatima]: Bae and Associates Law Firm, my name is Fatima, how may I assist you today?
[00:07] [Dr. Foster]: Hi, this is Dr. Foster.
[00:09] [Fatima]: You want to speak to Devon?
[00:12] [Dr. Foster]: No, no, I- I just couldn't hear what your name was.
[00:17] [Fatima]: Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Fatima.
[00:20] [Dr. Foster]: Fatima, oh okay, hi Fatima. Yes, my name is Dr. Foster with Vitality Center. I spoke uh maybe about an- an hour ago with Devon regarding a- case status. He mentioned that a- case had been paid out- for a- client that we've been treating of yours, her name is Kamisha Lewis. This- he stated that it had been paid out earlier, we received payment- for- maybe- sometime in July or something, and I did the research and it- we have not- with my- thanks, and we have not received any payment for this patient, this client that you have. I'm wondering if- if there are, I don't know, notes- for calls that we make with you guys or anything like that that you can see sort of the correspondence- that I've made with Devon earlier today?
[01:21] [Fatima]: What was the client's first and last name?
[01:24] [Dr. Foster]: Yes, Kamisha- is that with a K?

[02:23] [Fatima]: My system is still loading for me, I'm so sorry for the delay.
[02:28] [Dr. Foster]: Yes, take your time.
[02:30] [Fatima]: Um, I don't have a Kamisha, I have a here- when was the date of loss? Let me- let me confirm.
[02:36] [Dr. Foster]: Sure, uh- date of loss 6/9/21.
[02:41] [Fatima]: 21, oh definitely. Oh, it must be archived. Just caught myself, let me check the archived files.
[02:47] [Dr. Foster]: Yeah, it is archived, I- I do know that much.
[02:50] [Fatima]: Yeah, that's why it's not coming up for me. All right, so here we go now. Yes, I do see here that Devon had left notes, and he did left notes for a Mr. Matt McCarren. Um, yeah, for sure. Can I give you- his email and also Michael Soul, which is- the one that actually handles payments?
[03:15] [Dr. Foster]: Sure, actually Michael- he actually has emailed me. Okay, I have his email here, Michael Soul, michael@baeandassociates.com, so just explain everything to them?
[03:27] [Fatima]: Yes, exactly, right, 'cause they are the ones that handle payments, and I'm not sure if he's out for lunch, but usually when we call they don't answer, but if you'd like to, I would give it a try, and if he's not available I'll transfer you.
[03:34] [Dr. Foster]: Okay, yeah, let's just try to give it a try. Uh-huh.
[03:38] [Fatima]: All right, bear with me.
