[00:00] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling Bey and Associates Law Firm. My name is Fatima. How may I assist you?
[00:08] [Sumitra]: Uh, yes. My name is Sumitra and I'm calling from the Hurt 911 and I'm calling in regards to a non-compliant client and I need to see if I can speak to the case manager to see if I can go ahead and prep her up for release.
[00:23] [Receptionist]: Understood. May I please have the client's first and last name? I'll see if the case manager's available.
[00:28] [Sumitra]: Okay. It's D-A-Y-A-N-A, last name Gardner.

[00:51] [Receptionist]: All right. So the case manager is Ms. Paige Allman. Before I see if she's available, would you like to have her email and phone number?
[00:59] [Sumitra]: I don't need it. I already have it. It's just she's not returning my phone calls.
