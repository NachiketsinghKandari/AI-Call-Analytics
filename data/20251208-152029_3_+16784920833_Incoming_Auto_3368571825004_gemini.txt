----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, this is Stasha, how may I help you?
[00:06] [Carlotta Hughes]: Hey Stasha, how you doing?
[00:08] [Receptionist]: I'm doing great, ma'am. How are you today?
[00:10] [Carlotta Hughes]: Okay. This is Carlotta Hughes calling and, um, I have been waiting for a call back for a couple of months now and I'm just trying to figure out why no matter when I call, nobody responds. Is, um, my worker available today or the lawyer by any chance?
[00:26] [Receptionist]: Can I— do you know your attorney's name, ma'am?
[00:30] [Carlotta Hughes]: Do I know what?
[00:31] [Receptionist]: Your attorney's name?
[00:33] [Carlotta Hughes]: Uh, Middleton, I think.
[00:38] [Receptionist]: Middleton. One moment. Could you spell out your last name for me, please, ma'am?
[00:43] [Carlotta Hughes]: H-U-G-H-E-S, Hughes.
[00:51] [Receptionist]: Carlotta Hughes. One moment. Do I know if it's an M? I can never remember her name.
[01:05] [Receptionist]: Yes, I see that it is Ms. Taylor Middleton, ma'am.
[01:11] [Carlotta Hughes]: Yeah, she's never in the office for the past, two— let me see, I've been calling since September. So, not even to receive one call back yet, not an email, not an anything. Every time I speak to someone, you guys are so polite and sweet, "Oh, Ms. Hughes, we're gonna have somebody call you back, blah blah blah." No one's still called me back. I just need her to approve my loan so that Preferred Capital will give it to me. She told me to call her in 90 days and, uh, actually she said 30 and then 90, so I'm calling again. And I just need her to, you know, and to give me an update on my case, like what the heck is going on? I haven't heard anything since the deposition and I've left several messages and I don't understand why she's not responding or why a case manager, someone isn't— even if there is no update, you know what I'm saying? Just say, "Oh, Ms. Hughes, just getting back to you, well we don't have any updates, nothing's changed, we're still waiting, blah blah blah." They're totally disregarding me as a client and it doesn't feel comfortable. But it's okay, I know they're busy, I know they got a million cases, I get all that. I know it's holiday time, I'm not tripping. I just need to hear from somebody and I need some assistance because I need a loan, so I need them— the underwriter said they're waiting to speak to somebody there. So, how fair is that?
[02:24] [Receptionist]: I understand, ma'am. Um, let me see who I can get you over to. I'm gonna do my best, I'm not— I'm not gonna make any promises, but I'm— I'll try my best, okay?
[02:36] [Carlotta Hughes]: Okay. Yep, I appreciate you.
[02:40] [Receptionist]: All right. One second.
[02:42] [Carlotta Hughes]: Okay.
