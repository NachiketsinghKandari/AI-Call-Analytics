----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates Matt speaking how may I help you?
[00:04] [Sharkevia]: Hi good afternoon my name is Sharkevia I'm calling from Geico Claims on a recorded line looking to speak with Linda in regards to Jabria Shelton.
[00:13] [Receptionist]: One moment okay?
[00:15] [Sharkevia]: No problem.
[00:16] [ ... Silence (15s) ... ]
[00:31] [Receptionist]: She looks like she's at lunch but I can help you out with the follow-up.
[00:35] [Sharkevia]: Okay I was calling in regards to an offer that was extended for the settlement of the claim um I extended our policy limits over to your client and I sent it to Linda via email on the 15th.
[00:51] [Receptionist]: Oh okay um yeah as long as it's I mean are you offering it with a limited liability release?
[00:57] [Sharkevia]: Yes.
[00:58] [Receptionist]: Yeah if you want to send that over I can update that to her and let her know she might just not have missed might have missed we get a lot of emails I'm sure you're in the same boat.
[01:08] [Sharkevia]: Hahaha okay do you need like a tax ID payment instructions?
[01:12] [Sharkevia]: Payment instructions let me see uh where's the email uh for some reason I don't know what's been going on with our emails but they've been a little wonky.
[01:29] [Receptionist]: It's okay.
[01:31] [Sharkevia]: And okay here it is maybe that maybe it's just going uh so yes acceptance um and I advised that we in exchange for a limited liability release uh protection of liens and check instructions.
[01:51] [Receptionist]: Yeah we can hold harmless um any liens it looks like there is an Emory lien notice of 3336 and 40 cents.
[02:01] [Sharkevia]: Okay would you like me to get it emailed over to you for response?
[02:05] [Receptionist]: Yeah just Matt M-A-T-T at beyandassociates.com.
[02:11] [Receptionist]: And I can hang on just to make sure we actually—
[02:13] [Sharkevia]: Oh you're fine I just wanted to make sure I know she called me um when because the claim's pretty new um and she was telling me about uh the Grady and the follow-up well I didn't well I do actually I got the Grady bill on yesterday.
[02:27] [Receptionist]: Yeah it's like 57,000.
[02:30] [Receptionist]: Something of that sort yeah it's a big deal I'm looking at well I'm looking at a summary of the medicals yeah okay.
[02:38] [Sharkevia]: Now I was waiting for that I initially got the um the Emory one but I didn't have the Grady one and then the Grady one came in so I was like yeah that's enough.
[02:52] [Receptionist]: Yeah makes sense.
[02:54] [Receptionist]: Okay and you said that's just M-A-T-T?
[02:58] [Sharkevia]: Yeah then at beyandassociates.com yep.
[03:04] [Receptionist]: Perfect.
[03:05] [ ... Silence (26s) ... ]
[03:31] [Sharkevia]: Okay it's sent it may take a second for it to come through.
[03:36] [Receptionist]: That's fine I don't mind waiting a minute just to make sure we get this wrapped up she actually made a note but I guess she just didn't respond to the email or something she there's a note that y'all were um you were tendering.
[03:53] [Receptionist]: And it looks like she emailed on the 15th to myclaim@geicomail.com uh settlement confirmation is that not a correct email address?
[04:07] [Sharkevia]: So I I would say it depends sometimes it comes through sometimes it doesn't I know um they were piloting they were piloting an email kind of sort of deal so sometimes we get emails directly to the file from an email I'm I'm not sure because I just always send it this way that way I can ensure that I get it.
[04:30] [Receptionist]: Yeah yeah yeah no worries and the nice thing is she already has a settlement confirmation uh PDF uh already prepared so I'll just attach it and respond I'll just say we acknowledge uh and accept your tender of the 25k policy limits see instructions for payment in the attached confirmation that work?
[05:01] [Sharkevia]: Uh yes that's fine and uh yeah it's got her address the 4200 Northside Parkway Northwest Atlanta Georgia 30327 is and then so you just mail it you overnight that the check and the and we'll go from there.
[05:14] [Receptionist]: Yes that's the plan.
[05:16] [Receptionist]: Okay I just responded I don't mind waiting to make sure you get it as well.
[05:20] [Sharkevia]: No problem.
[05:21] [ ... Silence (22s) ... ]
[05:43] [Sharkevia]: I figured that would be easy enough.
[05:46] [Receptionist]: Yeah yeah I mean I appreciate that because sometimes like we'll get in the situation and then the the insurance company or the adjuster be like well I need all the bills and I'm like do you really need all the bills? Like is that real is that really a productive use of your time or ours like when you have double the double the medicals just from the hospital.
[06:11] [Sharkevia]: Right look when I heard when I saw well when I heard Grady and saw the police report I was like yeah but of course I mean I needed something so a bill you and especially you know with the 25 clear liability uh you know that that that's easy.
[06:30] [Receptionist]: Yeah of course makes sense.
[06:33] [Sharkevia]: How are you guys working next week?
[06:35] [Receptionist]: Um a lot of people are off but we're we're open the first couple days um on the 23rd we are doing like our like our little holiday lunch I think most people are off the 24th 5th and 6th um we we actually have an offshore group that answers the phones and stuff and they're on a some of them are on a different holiday schedule so they actually can um answer the phones and stuff but yeah we're we'll mostly be shut down after the 23rd what about you guys?
[07:19] [Sharkevia]: Uh well I am working so um I'll be off on Christmas and then um I'll be off the I'll be off New Year's and the day after New Year's because I I work from home so I mean any the rest of the shopping that I'm gonna do is gonna be this weekend and let's just go from there.
[07:42] [Receptionist]: I did a lot of online and then uh I'm taking all the in-laws that are still alive and my kids we're going to Cirque du Soleil on Friday as part of their uh for the for the grandparents that's their gift is we're taking them like to dinner and to Cirque du Soleil but yeah I I'm not even going to a store I think the presents we've gotten are all getting shipped to the house.

[08:14] [Sharkevia]: I am I am in Macon.
[08:16] [Receptionist]: We were just there we we have a small office there we actually had our uh holiday party at the Tubman Museum this past weekend.
[08:23] [Sharkevia]: Okay.
[08:24] [Receptionist]: It was really cool that's a cool facility yeah I liked it so um okay well um I don't know how long it takes for the emails to come through.
[08:34] [Sharkevia]: I think it may have came through let's see no I don't think so but I'm pretty sure it will so as soon as I have it um I'll be more than happy to get that release over to you guys for review and of course if there's anything else I can do for you in the meantime please feel free to give me a call and um once I have it uploaded I'll go ahead and um get that email the release emailed over to you.
