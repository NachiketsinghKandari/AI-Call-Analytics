[01:38] [Receptionist]: Yes, it is archived. Mm-hmm.
[01:41] [Olivia]: Okay. What— what does that mean?
[01:43] [Receptionist]: That means that the state is closed. We already paid what's the compensation. The case is done. Mm-hmm.
[01:51] [Olivia]: Um, is there someone I could talk to, uh, because I— we just didn't get paid out for United Spine and Ortho, or maybe just to see where that check got sent to?
[02:04] [Receptionist]: Let's see, because I can check that information.
[02:11] [Olivia]: Thank you.
[02:12] [ ... Silence (17s) ... ]
[02:29] [Receptionist]: We have United Spine and Ortho for 3,150. The check was mailed out. Yes, it was mailed, let me tell you when. Actually, it was on June 26th this year. And I have the check number.
[02:49] [Olivia]: Okay. One second. Um, okay, I'm ready for the check number.
[02:55] [Receptionist]: It is 37882 from Bank of America.
[03:07] [Olivia]: Bank of America. And then, uh, you said it was 3,000 and...
[03:13] [Receptionist]: 150. Are you United Spine and Ortho, right?
[03:18] [Olivia]: Well, we purchased their medical bills from them and then they have closed down, um, so they're not no longer open. So we're technically supposed to get paid out for it, but we've been running into this problem a lot where they were accepting checks for a half when we were supposed to receive them. So just— this has been happening, so I'll just add it to my list of missing checks. Um, are you able to see if it was cashed or not?
[03:59] [Olivia]: Hello?
[04:01] [Receptionist]: Sorry, I lost you for a minute. What did you say?
[04:04] [Olivia]: Oh, you're good. Um, are you able to see if the check was cashed or not?
[04:09] [Receptionist]: Oh, I don't have that information. You will need to try to get in contact with Bank of America, provide for them the date and the check information and they can— they can provide for you the bank. Mm-hmm.
[04:21] [Olivia]: Okay, no worries. I will do that. Um, and then, are you okay if I ask you about one more patient?
[04:27] [Receptionist]: That's okay. Give me just one moment.
