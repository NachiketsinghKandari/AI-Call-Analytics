----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Just a second, let me see if I can get him on.
[00:05] [Darnell Stallworth]: Hello. Hello?
[00:10] [Receptionist]: Yes, um, can you hear me?
[00:12] [Darnell Stallworth]: Yeah. Um, yeah, I need to speak to a manager or something, um, because, uh, you guys picked my case up last year for accident and then y'all dropped me but y'all never sent the withdrawal letter out and they've been sending y'all a request for the withdrawal every three months and y'all haven't responded. And they just sent y'all one on the first and y'all haven't responded. The only person y'all withdrew from the case was Teagea Scott. My name is Darnell Stallworth.
[00:46] [Receptionist]: Yes, I think I spoke with you before. Uh, I did tell you that we do not have a case. The case, it is completely closed in our archives. I mean, there's no way—
[00:56] [Darnell Stallworth]: Right, but on Country Financial and they said you— y'all only sent the withdrawal letter for Teagea and not me.
[01:04] [Receptionist]: Country Financial?
[01:07] [Darnell Stallworth]: Yes. So he wants to— they want you to get in contact with them because on it's still saying that you guys have me down as representation.
[01:25] [Receptionist]: All right, let me, uh, let me get someone. One second.
