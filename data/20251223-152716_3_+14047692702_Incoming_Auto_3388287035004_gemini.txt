----------------------------------------

[00:02] [Receptionist]: Thank you for calling Bey and Associates. This is Daniel.
[00:07] [Speaker 2]: Hey, how you doing? I was calling to see how much do y'all charge. Do y'all charge 25 percent or 33 percent to do a case?
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Um, yeah, our normal percent is 33 percent.
[00:23] [Speaker 2]: Okay, well thank you.
[00:25] [Receptionist]: The lowest we can do is 28 percent.
[00:29] [Speaker 2]: 28 percent?
[00:30] [Receptionist]: Yeah.
[00:31] [Speaker 2]: Where y'all located?
[00:33] [Receptionist]: We are in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:36] [Speaker 2]: Okay, you say 28 percent? Well let me get back, let me ask my husband and see because I know we was in an accident. Um, so let me ask him and see.
[00:50] [Receptionist]: Okay. The best op— um, you know, the benefit from us is that we also offer litigation services so we can definitely, um, take your case until the end.
[01:02] [Speaker 2]: You can do what?
[01:04] [Receptionist]: I mean, we offer litigation services so we can definitely help your case until the end. Sometimes other firms offer 25 but then they do not offer litigation, meaning that if they cannot settle with the other driver's insurance they will just withdraw, but we do have the option of always going to court and everything.
[01:29] [Speaker 2]: Oh, okay then.
[01:32] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Just make sure, you know, that if you hire, you know, someone else, you know, just make sure they do offer litigation so that way you can have your case completely covered.
[01:43] [Speaker 2]: Okay. All right. All right, thank you.
[01:49] [Receptionist]: Thank you.
