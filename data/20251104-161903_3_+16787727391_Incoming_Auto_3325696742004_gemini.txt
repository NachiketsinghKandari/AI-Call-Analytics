[00:00] [Receptionist]: Stein and Associates, this is Pasha, how may I help you?
[00:07] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: Hi Pasha, um, this is Alicia. I wanted to see if I could speak with somebody about, um, my, um, accident that I had, uh, couple weeks ago.
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Okay. You're looking for representation or you currently are represented?
[00:24] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: I'm with someone, but I really don't, um, like the way they're communicating, they're not communicating, um, and, uh, nothing they're saying is making sense, so I just want someone else to confirm what they're saying, um, and I'm thinking about switching. So, I wanted to see how you guys can help me and if it's a better option for me because somebody else referred me to, to you. I'm with Bader Law right now, um, and this person told me that they've been with Bader Law and they didn't get anything out of, um, the accident that they were in and they weren't at fault. Um, yeah. And I'm just, like, really struggling. I'm out of work, um, they're not doing anything, they're still telling me, like, it's an investigation for a week now. Um, all I know is that the driver that hit me, it was a taxi company called Cascade Cabs in Atlanta. Um, they told me that the driver was excluded from the insurance, so I don't know what that means. That means that he's not covered by, um, the company's insurance. I know they go with Root Insurance. Um, last that I know that they have accepted fault for the accident. My car is still at a tow yard, nobody's towed it, and my lawyer is telling me that I have to go pay for the tow, um, unless I have, I go and open a claim with my insurance and then it's all taken care of, but I don't want to open a claim with my insurance because I don't want my insurance to get affected. Um, I've been suffering from really bad back pain, uh, in my back, lower back, um, neck, shoulder, um, spreading down to my right arm, uh, to the elbow. I've been seeing doctors, a chiropractor, um, an orthopedic. I'm told to make an appointment with an MRI because there's no damage to my spine or, like, any bone damage, but, um, I think it's, like, nerve damage more likely. Um, they're telling me that they're only covered up to 25k for bodily injury and 25 for, um, vehicle, um, or, like, auto repair or whatever. And then, um, yeah, that's about it. And they told me that I wouldn't really get anything out of it other than them negotiating medical bills and then whatever's left from that 25k would come to me and then they would get 25% out of that. So, anything that would happen to me long-term, I have to be responsible for my medical bills. So, I don't have that kind of money to go get treated for my back. I'm a caregiver and I have to bend and I have to kneel and I have to get on the ground and up and down and carry wheelchairs and stuff like that. So, that's not really ideal for me. So, I need somewhat of a comp for all of this that's happened to me. And I've been out of a job for two weeks. So, I can't pay rent, I can't pay groceries, I don't have any money to go pick up my car from a tow yard. I don't have anything. So, I'm just sitting here in the dark and nobody's helping me, nobody's doing anything for me to feel like, hey, we're taking care of you. Nothing like that.
[03:37] [Receptionist]: Can I have your name, ma'am?
[03:41] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: It's Alicia, E-L-Y-S-I-A. My last name is A-B-D-E-L-R-A-Z-E-K.
[03:51] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[03:52] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[04:01] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: All right. Well, I'm sorry. This is all my frustration for two weeks now and it's crazy.
[04:06] [Receptionist]: Basically, the description you gave us, um, is more or less just how the procedure works. Um, about their pol- their limits, um, I'm not sure because we would have to do our own investigation, ma'am, about you're stating that it's 25 to 25. Um, that's normally how much it is. That's the average, unfortunately. Um, but, um, if you want to consult with an attorney because I'm not- I'm not an attorney, I'm not allowed to give out legal advice. I can arrange that for you. I can see if someone's available right now to take your call. You can explain them your situation and they will let you know if we can assist you or not. We can assist you or not.
[04:34] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: Okay. All right.
[04:36] [Receptionist]: And you said this happened in Georgia, is that correct, ma'am?
[04:40] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: Yeah, in Atlanta.
[04:42] [Receptionist]: In Atlanta. All righty. One moment then. Let me get you over to see if the attorney's available.
[04:52] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: All right. Thank you.
[04:54] [ ... Silence (18s) ... ]
[05:13] [Receptionist]: Ms. Alice- Ms. Alicia?
[05:21] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: Yes, Alicia.
[05:23] [Receptionist]: Alicia, um, I'm sorry. Um, yes, unfortunately, I wasn't able to get any attorney at this hour, but I did consult with my supervisor and I was told to to send them an email letting them to reach out to you as soon as possible. Can I have your- can you please confirm your contact number for me, please, ma'am?
[05:43] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: Yes. 6-7-8-7-7-2-7-3-9-1.
[05:49] [Receptionist]: All right. Perfect. Um, I will send them this email and someone should reach out to you within the next 24 hours, ma'am.
[05:59] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: Okay. Thank you so much.
[06:01] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. You have a good day.
[06:03] [Elysia Abdelrazek]: Me too. Thank you.
[06:05] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much.
