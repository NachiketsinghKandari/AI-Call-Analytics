[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates Law Firm, this is Kareem, what can I do for you today?
[00:06] [Carlotta Hughes]: Hi, this is Carlotta Hughes calling. Hopefully you can get me somebody on the phone who can answer some questions because nobody's called me back and this is going on two months. I keep calling and keep calling and keep calling to not get a response, to not get an email, to not get a text message, to not get anything and I'm getting a little frustrated. Um...
[00:24] [Receptionist]: What is your name?
[00:26] [Carlotta Hughes]: Carlotta. And my last name is Hughes.
[00:31] [Carlotta Hughes]: Every time I call they say the lawyers are out of out of the office or she's in court or uh you know it's never anybody available and it's always a lie. It's always oh somebody's going to call you back, I'll make sure somebody calls you back today and I know you guys can't make sure of anything, I know that, but don't tell me that and nobody ever calls. You know, so...
[00:52] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me see if she's available.
[00:55] [Carlotta Hughes]: Thank you, baby.
[00:56] [Receptionist]: Just one moment. Thank you.
