Uh let me try to reach out to them.
[01:09] [Bert Carrington]: Yeah well let me just tell you what the issue is. We're we're done with the case, right? We're I'm just trying to find out from uh there was another party that was in the accident with me. She's already gotten her uh the letter you guys sent out to get the uh the money sent to her, the the settlement sent to her. I'm waiting to to get any communication. I don't know if you sent it out to me because it may have gone into junk or spam. I just can't find it. And didn't know if you actually had gotten everything together for me because we were in the same accident, same uh you know medical providers and everything. So if you finished with hers, you finished with mine but I haven't heard anything. So I was just trying to get a status update and how much uh is still left outstanding for you guys to send to me.
