[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bena and Associates Law Firm, Devon speaking.
[00:05] [Speaker 2]: Hi, how are you? I was calling because, um, I wanted to make an appointment. Um, my son was prescribed... I wanted to even know if it was like worth even making an appointment for. Um, my son was prescribed medication for an adult, like, I went to the doctor yesterday, they said he had ADHD and then they prescribed him, um, something called Guanfacine, but there's two different types. And one is for high blood pressure and one is for ADHD. He was supposed to get the one for ADHD, but they, uh, prescribed him the one that was for high blood pressure for children over the age of 12 years old. And is that like, am I able to do anything about that?

[ ... Silence (5s) ... ]

[00:53] [Speaker 2]: Hello?
[00:55] [Receptionist]: No, I'm here. So, you're looking to get a case for a wrong prescription?
[01:06] [Speaker 2]: Correct.
[01:08] [Receptionist]: Now, um, did he take anything?
[01:23] [Speaker 2]: No, he didn't take it. Um, he just got prescribed it and then I was doing my research and it... and then I read the the label, the packaging, and it says only use for high blood pressure. And he doesn't have... he's like 100% healthy, he just has ADHD. So the meds were supposed to be Intuniv is what he was supposed to be getting. So it's under the Guanfacine family, Intuniv, but they gave him the one that's for high blood pressure for adults.
[01:54] [Receptionist]: Okay. So basically it was a confusion. They gave... they prescribed the wrong medication to him. Um, luckily he hasn't taken any of it. Unfortunately for that type of case like this, ma'am, we wouldn't be able to open a file.
[02:12] [Speaker 2]: Because he didn't take it?
[02:14] [Receptionist]: Because it hasn't caused him to have any action, any reaction to it.
[02:19] [Speaker 2]: Alrighty then, thank you.
[02:22] [Receptionist]: You're welcome.
