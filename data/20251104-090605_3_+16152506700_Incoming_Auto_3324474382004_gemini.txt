[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bay and Associates, how can I help you?
[00:04] [Lynn]: Hey, good morning. My name is Lynn. I'm calling from First Acceptance Insurance. Um, please be advised this call is being recorded for quality and training purposes. Is it okay to continue?
[00:15] [Receptionist]: Yes.
[00:16] [Lynn]: Okay. Yes, sir. I'm calling to follow up. Um, client is Ambrose McDonald, Adam Sharp, and Jaden Sharp.
[00:28] [Receptionist]: Yeah.
[00:29] [Lynn]: Um, yes, sir. So, (coughs) excuse me. So this claim was transferred over to me for a date of loss 10/26 of '25. Um, we had it noted before that they were going through the other at-fault party's carrier. Is that still the case or are they wanting to go ahead and move forward with First Acceptance?
[00:52] [Receptionist]: I don't know. Let me get you over to, uh, Stephanie. She's the case manager handling it.
[00:57] [Lynn]: Okay.
[00:58] [Receptionist]: Would you like her email as well?
[01:00] [Lynn]: Um, yes, please.
[01:02] [Receptionist]: It's just her first name. She spells it a little different. It's S-T-E-P-H-A-N-I-E, uh, at bayandassociates.com. So stephanie@bayandassociates.com.
[01:19] [Lynn]: At dot com.
[01:20] [Receptionist]: And her direct dial is—I'll transfer you as well, but it's 470-645-1748.
[01:30] [Lynn]: Okay, thank you.
[01:32] [Receptionist]: Yep, one moment.
