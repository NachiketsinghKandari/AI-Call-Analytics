[00:03] [Daniela Espinoza]: Hi Angelo, my name is Daniela Espinoza. I'm calling from Rockpoint Legal Funding and I'm wondering if I could please speak to the case manager or attorney for Shantel Holley?
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Shantel. Let's see. How do you spell Shantel?

[00:59] [Receptionist]: Okay. So the name is Jaela Kennedy. So the case manager, let's see if she's available, okay? Hold on.
[01:10] [Daniela Espinoza]: Thank you so much.
