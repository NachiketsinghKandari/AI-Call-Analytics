[01:00] [Kevin]: Andrea, this is about the pending payment, right?
[01:04] [Andrea]: Yes. Uh, I've been actually calling since, um, April of this year trying to get this resolved and I keep getting told that it has to be looked into by the billing department. There was a check issued, but the check never came. There was supposed to be a re- reissued check, which also has never came. Um, when I took this- when I took over doing this position, I've been calling since April 17th of this year pretty much regularly and I have received no updates on what's going on with this payment.
[01:33] [Kevin]: Okay.
[01:34] [Andrea]: I've been leaving numerous voicemails for Anita herself, plus Kadeem Gibson. I've been speaking with him. I can't email him. He- he requested me to email him. I can't. It's blocked for some reason. Um, I've left, um, email with detailed information for a Michael. I don't have a last name. Um, and then I've spoke with Kimmy- Kimmy, Brittany, uh, Christian. Um, just trying to get an update on this. We have not received payment. The checks have not came. If- and I guess they were supposed to be looking into if they were ever cashed.
[02:21] [Kevin]: Yes, I do see the numerous, um, messages here left for the team, right, to put this under investigation and also the reissue of the number one. I'm not sure if the check was reissued yet or what happened, but we can take a look into it, okay?
[02:40] [Andrea]: 'Cause the- the patient did call me back this morning and said that- that according to the conversation she had with somebody on your end, that nobody has reached out to you guys to let you guys know the payment never came.
[02:53] [Kevin]: Hmm.
[02:54] [ ... Silence (10s) ... ]
[03:04] [Kevin]: Okay. So let me get a hold of Kadeem.
[03:08] [Andrea]: Yeah, the last person I spoke with was Kadeem.
