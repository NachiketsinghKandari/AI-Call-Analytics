[00:15] [Dante]: Hi, how you doing? I'm calling in regards to your client, uh, Dejon Rainwater.
[00:22] [Evan]: One second. Okay. Dejon Rainwater. How can I help you?
[00:29] [Dante]: Uh, yeah, um, trying to get some information from you guys if you can. Um, two things, um, I'm pretty much reaching out for is we are trying to get photos of the vehicle, um, and we're unable to get in contact with Geico to get those. I think a claim wasn't filed on your guys' insurance side. Um, but do you possibly have photos of the vehicle, um, so I can, uh, add it over to my claim?
[01:06] [Evan]: Okay, let me check on that here. And you said you were calling from what insurance again?
[01:14] [Dante]: Progressive Insurance.
[01:16] [Evan]: Progressive. Okay. Let me get you over to Victoria. She'd be more than happy to assist with that. She's the case manager. So let me pull this up here and get you over to Victoria, okay?
[01:29] [Dante]: Okay, no problem.
[01:31] [Evan]: Thank you.
