----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates Law Firm, Devon speaking.
[00:07] [Speaker 2]: Hi Devon. I've been trying to get a hold of an... what's her name? So sorry. India, I think... India Miller. Um, and I've left her three or four voicemails over the last two days. We have, um, a deposition tomorrow. We're a doctor's office. Um, we haven't received payment. I do know that we made a special arrangements on a day the doctor doesn't normally do depositions, so I think she doesn't want me to cancel this, but I can't get anyone to call me back. Um, if I gave you the patient's name, could you is maybe see if there's someone else working on her team that could talk to me?
[00:43] [Receptionist]: Of course, of course. I'd be more than happy to assist you. Um, what is the client's first and last name, please?
[00:57] [Speaker 2]: Mine? Or the patient? Patient. Okay. It's Jionetta, J-O-N-E-T-T-A, and the last name is Corley, C-O-R-L-E-Y. I don't have the date of injury, but I do have the date of birth.
[01:12] [Receptionist]: Okay. I'm guessing this would be the one that India was working on, so it would be... um, 2020. Okay, so let me see here.
[01:32] [Speaker 2]: Is she in today?
[01:35] [Receptionist]: No, ma'am. She is not available at the moment.
[01:38] [Speaker 2]: Well then I probably need to talk to somebody on her... I started a couple days ago asking her about this, so I don't know if she's been out all week, but I don't have any of the information including payment.
[01:46] [Receptionist]: Mhm. And you said you were calling from a doctor's office, right?
[01:52] [Speaker 2]: Yeah. Barbour Ortho, B-A-R-B-O-U-R Orthopedic. Okay.
[02:14] [Receptionist]: The next person working on this file is Ms. Taylor Middleton. Um, okay. That is the attorney. Let me see if Taylor is available.
[02:32] [Speaker 2]: I'd hate to bother the attorney, but I mean, I will if I have to because I think this is pretty important.
[02:35] [Receptionist]: I am working on this one right now. Let me see if I can get onto the person handling the disbursement area here, okay? Regarding payment.
[02:42] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.
[02:43] [Receptionist]: All right. No problem. I'm going to put you on a brief hold.
[02:45] [Speaker 2]: Payment, I need not only payment, but I need, um, the Zoom information. I'm worried that maybe she's not getting in tomorrow either and she's my only contact on this.
[02:52] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[02:53] [ ... Silence (20s) ... ]
[03:13] [Speaker 2]: I'm on hold, but I just checked everything again and I still don't have anything. Hello?
[03:19] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for patiently holding on me. I tried reaching Veronica Brown. Veronica Brown is, um, working on the file because India's not available, but unfortunately I was not able to connect with her. I think she stepped out of the office. I can provide you her email so you can reach out, um, in regards to the Zoom and the payment, and also provide you her number so you can reach out to her by phone directly, okay?
[03:48] [Speaker 2]: Okay.
[03:49] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, her phone number is 404-220-7877.
[03:52] [Speaker 2]: Mhm.
[03:54] [Receptionist]: 220...
[03:56] [Speaker 2]: Yes.
[03:57] [Receptionist]: 7877.
[03:59] [Speaker 2]: Okay.
[04:01] [Receptionist]: And her email would be V as in Victor and her last name Brown, like the color, at Bey, yes ma'am, at B-E-Y and associates dot com.
[04:21] [Speaker 2]: Okay. I will reach out to her. Veronica...
[04:24] [Receptionist]: Yes, Veronica will be your new point of contact, um, since India's not available on this one, but if anything, let me know, okay?
[04:32] [Speaker 2]: Is India with the company no longer?
[04:37] [Receptionist]: Unfortunately not.
[04:39] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Her attorney's going to be not happy with her because this is a Hail Mary and and we gotta... I'll try Veronica now. Um, maybe this has got settled and we'll see whatever. But I appreciate your help. What was your name?
[04:52] [Receptionist]: Devon.
[04:54] [Speaker 2]: Devon. Okay. Devon, I don't know, just a little, um, constructive criticism. If there was a message in her inbox, I would have reached out to whomever it said. There wasn't anything.
[05:06] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[05:08] [Speaker 2]: So you know, like if I when I emailed her, if it would have said please reach out to, you might want to, since she's working on other things, you might want to suggest that.
[05:15] [Receptionist]: Okay, I will suggest that. Normally there is, um, an alert that would pop up once you email one of the personnels in the office that were not available, you know, an emergency contact would, you know, show up, but I will, um, pass this message along for future references.
[05:31] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Thanks. All right. I appreciate your help, Devon.
[05:35] [Receptionist]: You too. Have a great one.
[05:38] [Speaker 2]: You too. Bye.
