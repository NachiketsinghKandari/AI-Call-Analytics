----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Baird Associates Law Firm, Devon speaking.
[00:06] [Kirstie]: Hi, Devon.
[00:08] [Receptionist]: Hi.
[00:09] [Kirstie]: Hello, my name is Kirstie. I actually just spoke with an associate there, I think Dyanel? I forgot how to pronounce it. Dyanel. Is that- does that sound familiar?
[00:21] [Receptionist]: Yes.
[00:23] [Kirstie]: Okay, got it. I just had a quick question before I kind of like make you guys, um, spend a lot of time with us. So, one thing I didn't clarify, this is about the Suboxone lawsuit. I saw you guys had something about that on the website. And, uh, we are in Georgia. So, um, well, the main thing is is I don't- I don't think my husband actually ever took the name brand Suboxone. He always was on the generic film. So, is that- is that disqualify us?
[00:57] [Receptionist]: I- it would have to be reviewed to be honest with you, miss, because they are basically looking for someone who has been on the name brand Suboxone itself and most likely on what would be the strip.
[01:14] [Kirstie]: Okay, got it. Yeah, so, um, I- I guess it wouldn't hurt to review it, um, just to see, but it sounds like we probably- we probably are not, uh, included.
[01:30] [Receptionist]: Right, correct, correct. So I'm guessing Mr. Dyanel mentioned that if you had a brief description of the period of time, the date, you know, from when you started, um, using it, and- and everything to send to his email or something for it to be reviewed, correct?
[01:51] [Kirstie]: Uh, yeah, yeah. I was gonna call back later and talk with, uh, the other representative. Um, so yeah, he was first prescribed in 2021. But yeah.
[02:02] [Receptionist]: Okay. All right.
[02:04] [Kirstie]: Yeah.
[02:05] [Receptionist]: Yeah, um, it wouldn't hurt to have it reviewed. You know, they always take a look into it before making any type of decision like that. So...
[02:14] [Kirstie]: Okay. Well, thanks- thanks. I just wanted to be sure.
[02:18] [Receptionist]: Yes, ma'am. No problem. No problem. More than happy to assist you, okay?
[02:23] [Kirstie]: Okay. Mm-hmm. I'll call back, uh, later when Chris is available.
[02:27] [Receptionist]: Perfect, perfect, perfect. Thank you so much.
[02:30] [Kirstie]: Sure. Have a good one. Bye.
[02:32] [Receptionist]: You too. Bye-bye.
