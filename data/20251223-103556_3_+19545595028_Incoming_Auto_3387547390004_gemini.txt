[00:13] [Receptionist]: Uh-huh, how can I help?
[00:15] [Unknown]: Um, so I was, um, I had a, I had a case that I was trying to, I was trying to find a lawyer and with my insurance, I had a car accident, um, a couple weeks ago and some stuff weren't done right in my, in my, with my insurance whatever, and I was trying to just figure out my next step on what to do.
[00:41] [Receptionist]: Okay, and was there any personal injury involved?

[02:00] [Unknown]: Um, December 11th.
[02:03] [Receptionist]: December 11th. Okay, we can, um, we can still go ahead and sign you up for treatment if you are looking to move forward. Um, what is the issue with your insurance, sir?
[02:16] [Unknown]: Well, I had, for my insurance, I was only covered for like liability, so I didn't have any coverage for collision or anything like that. But the problem is is with the other person's insurance where in the police report, they put some, they put the insurance, but it wasn't the right insurance. And when I asked my insurance to look because I had, I gave them my license plate and the license plate to the other driver, the VIN number, they, they were not able to find any active insurance on that car. And so from the police report as well, they had the information is completely wrong where we had had two witnesses come to the, um, to the scene to talk about with the cop, and he didn't write any information about the witnesses, and he didn't write the plate number of the other person who was at fault in the police report, and the numbers, the phone numbers were from, from my phone number in the police report and her phone number were cor- was not even right in the police report. It's just the police report itself wasn't even accurate itself.
[03:08] [Receptionist]: Okay. Yes. Um, let me get my supervisor and ask a few questions about this because if your insurance could not find an active, um, insurance, then that would be an issue. Just one second.

[03:57] [Unknown]: Yes, I do have it in a PDF form.
[04:01] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, would you be able to send it to me, sir? Then that way, that way I can have, um, the attorney review your case and see if we are able to go ahead and move forward.
