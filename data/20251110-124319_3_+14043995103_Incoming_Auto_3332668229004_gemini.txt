[00:00] [Dennis]: Bain and Associates Law Firm, Dennis speaking, good afternoon.
[00:06] [Ms. Jupiter]: Hi, how you doing? Dennis, this is Ms. Jupiter. 
[00:11] [Ms. Jupiter]: Um, can you connect me...
[00:13] [Dennis]: Huh?
[00:15] [Dennis]: Hi, good day. How can I assist you, ma'am?
[00:17] [Ms. Jupiter]: Can you connect me to Jim O'Brien, please?
[00:21] [Dennis]: Sure. Let me see if he's in the office. Let me double-check, okay?
[00:26] [Ms. Jupiter]: Okay, thank you.
[00:30] [Dennis]: Ms. Jupiter?
[00:32] [Ms. Jupiter]: Yes.
[00:34] [Dennis]: Seems like Mr. Jim O'Brien is not available, um, via phone. I just tried reaching him twice and...
[00:42] [Ms. Jupiter]: Look, I'm not understanding this. They have my case going on five years. I gotta keep calling them. Nobody call me. If they- they can't do nothing, I need to get me another attorney. Even John- John Bey, he don't even do nothing. And he told me don't leave. He busy, but he- he... I'm not understanding this. It's like they just throw me to the side. I lost my husband and his children want to know, uh, what they doing. If they not doing nothing, I need to move on.
[01:14] [Ms. Jupiter]: So if nobody in the office that have the case with him?
[01:19] [Dennis]: Yes, I was gonna tell you he's not available, but let me try reaching out to your case manager, Susan.
[01:27] [Ms. Jupiter]: Because this is too much.
[01:32] [Dennis]: Yeah, he's been in the- in the court for the past couple of weeks. So let me try reaching out to someone for you, alright?
[01:43] [Ms. Jupiter]: Okay.
[01:45] [Dennis]: Thank you.
