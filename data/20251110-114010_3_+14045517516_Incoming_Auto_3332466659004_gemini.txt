----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Banyan and Stokes Law Firm, Devin speaking.
[00:05] [Dr. Betty]: Hey, uh, my name is Dr. Betty. I'm calling from Serenity Chiropractic and Rehab. I left a message with you guys last week. I was calling to see when can we pick up our check?
[00:17] [Receptionist]: Okay. And this is regarding what case specifically?
[00:21] [Dr. Betty]: Um, it is Cambria Hartnett.
[00:24] [Receptionist]: Cambria...
[00:28] [ ... Silence (14s) ... ]
[00:43] [Receptionist]: Cambria, last name?
[00:46] [Dr. Betty]: Hartnett.
[00:49] [Receptionist]: Hardwood?
[00:51] [Dr. Betty]: I think it's Hartnett. Let me look in my, uh, my file, uh, email. I think it's H-A-R-D-N-E-T-T, I want to say.
[01:01] [Receptionist]: Got it. You got it? Yeah, let's see. Let me pull up the file. I think it's Hartnett, yes. H-A-R- H-A-R-D-N-E-double T.
[01:07] [Dr. Betty]: Yeah.
[01:16] [Receptionist]: Let's take a look. Let's look at this disbursement real quick.
[01:30] [Dr. Betty]: I'm sorry?
[01:34] [Receptionist]: I'm looking at the disbursement to see what's up.
[01:37] [Dr. Betty]: Oh, okay.
[01:49] [ ... Silence (20s) ... ]
[02:10] [Receptionist]: Hmm. I don't see Serenity listed on this disbursement.
[02:13] [Dr. Betty]: She, uh, she attended two Serenity Chiropractics. One was Serenity Chiropractic and one was Serenity Chiropractic and Rehab.
[02:20] [ ... Silence (20s) ... ]
[02:41] [Receptionist]: Serenity Chiro and Rehab and Serenity Injury Center. There's two, right?
[02:48] [Dr. Betty]: Um, I know she went to another Serenity, uh, before she got to me for, yeah, but I'm Serenity Chiropractic and Rehab. That's me. I'm Rehab.
[02:59] [Receptionist]: Happy to hear. We do see here a check that was supposed to be made out. Let me get a hold of someone and see if the checks are ordered and when can you- when can you pick them up or where were they sent out. Let me take a look real quick, okay?
[03:15] [Dr. Betty]: We prefer to pick our checks up.
[03:17] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me take a look real quick, okay?
[03:21] [Dr. Betty]: Yeah.
[03:27] [Receptionist]: I am so sorry for that delay. I do apologize. I was trying to reach out to the disbursement team that normally handles the check and disbursement, but unfortunately, I'm not getting a response. What I can do is I can request for someone to look into it.
[03:49] [Dr. Betty]: Um, the checks have been cut, so normally when people make, uh, they cut the checks, they cut everybody checks across the board. And I think her check, she's already picked up her check. So, um, I'm a little confused.
[04:03] [Receptionist]: Yes, I do see here that the request was sent for all provider checks to be ordered. So, we're just waiting for the accountant department, the accounting department to cut them out. I'm not sure why one was made out, um, and not the others. Like you said, if- if you cut one, all of them should be cut.
[04:31] [Dr. Betty]: Yeah, I've been doing this for a while, so I'm even married to an attorney. When you cut the checks, you cut everybody checks.
[04:38] [Receptionist]: Right. You cut one and get rid of everything else, you know, you- that's it. Um, let me look into it for you, miss. I do apologize, but I don't see nothing as of yet. I'm going to request- I'm going to update on that as quick as possible. Maybe you can give us a call back tomorrow?
[05:00] [Dr. Betty]: Um, is there no one there to, uh, to look into the situation right now? I'm just kind of baffled how all this, uh, played out and everything. Um, yeah. So what is the amount that you guys have down for me?
[05:25] [Receptionist]: Let's take a look.
[05:34] [ ... Silence (11s) ... ]
[05:46] [Receptionist]: I see here Serenity Chiropractic and Rehab, reduced bill, 3745.
[05:49] [Dr. Betty]: No, that is absolutely not right. Uh, we were willing to accept 8,000. The patient even wrote something. We signed a lien. Um, so we will not accept anything below 8,000. We reduced our bill to that and the bill was actually higher. So you should have something, the young lady sent me the notice that she signed and sent to you guys based and got a reduction on that to make sure that we got our money. So we- we're definitely not going for that. We would definitely get the bar involved.
[06:29] [Receptionist]: Yeah, what happens is I don't handle that information. I was trying to reach out to the person who...
[06:34] [Dr. Betty]: I need to speak to someone in that department because that's not happening. Absolutely not. And she took her reduction based upon us getting at least 8,000.
[06:47] [Receptionist]: Okay. Let me put you on a brief hold and get you connected to someone then.
[06:54] [Dr. Betty]: Sure.
[06:56] [ ... Silence (8s) ... ]
[07:05] [Receptionist]: Thank you for patiently holding on me. I did manage to get a hold of Tara. She's head of the disbursement team. And Tara's in a meeting right now. She asked if you can give her a minute, she will give you a call back regarding the disbursement.
[07:21] [Dr. Betty]: Okay. Sounds good.
[07:23] [Receptionist]: All right. Yes, she- she said she's going to give you a call back regarding it to let you know when the check will be ready and if it's already ready. Because I don't- I don't manage that info. I don't have it and I don't want to give you the incorrect one.
[07:36] [Dr. Betty]: Okay. Um, yeah, have her give me a call back.
[07:45] [Receptionist]: Okay. What is a good number?
[07:47] [Dr. Betty]: And where are you guys loc- where are you guys located at?
[07:50] [Receptionist]: On, well, our address directly is in Atlanta on Northside Parkway.
[07:59] [Dr. Betty]: Northside. I wasn't sure if it's Northside or Northlake.
[08:04] [Receptionist]: Yeah, um, it's 4200 Northside Parkway Northwest.
[08:12] [Dr. Betty]: Okay. All right, thank you.
