[00:02] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, Kimmy speaking?
[00:05] [Sametria]: Ah yes, my name is Sametria and I'm calling from the chiropractic office, Hurt 911 in Lithonia. And I need to see if I can speak to the case worker, we're treating one of y'all clients, first name is D-A-Y-A-N-A and last name Gardner. And I need to know what I need to go ahead and release her 'cause we can't hold folders for two weeks out.
[00:31] [Receptionist]: Okay. That would be with Paige Allman, let me get her for you. She's the case manager. So that's Dayana Gardner, right?
