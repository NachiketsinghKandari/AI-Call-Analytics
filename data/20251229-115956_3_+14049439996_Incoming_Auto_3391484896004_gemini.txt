[ ... Silence (38s) ... ]
[03:03] [Receptionist]: And let me tell you, for Mr. Gould, um, it looks like that there is no, there is no case manager assigned. It seems like there was one, but it looks like that that person is no longer working with the company because it says here prior employee. So he doesn't have a case manager assigned at the moment. Uh, this is what I can do. I can provide you with the case, with the email for the Mr., uh, Mr. Bey's legal assistant, Mr. Matt.
