[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bain and Associates, Gavin speaking, how can I help you?
[00:04] [Vanessa]: Hi Gavin, uh good morning. My name is Vanessa. I'm calling from Team Rehab. Um, I have a- a weird situation that I need assistance with. Um, a while back your firm told us Team Rehab that, I guess the- you guys transferred the file over to Calvin Smith Law, Daniel Johnson. Um, but now I have Daniel Johnson from Calvin Smith saying that he does not and never represented this patient and we're stuck with a high bill. So I just- I need to speak to someone to just to confirm information basically.
[00:30] [Receptionist]: Okay. What client are we talking about?
[00:32] [Vanessa]: Uh, Eugene Hudson.
[00:35] [ ... Silence (12s) ... ]
[00:47] [Receptionist]: What was the date of the loss?
[00:49] [Vanessa]: Uh, March 7, 2022.
[00:53] [ ... Silence (5s) ... ]
[00:58] [Vanessa]: I'm gonna get- I'm gonna get the- oh, it was Mabel that let us know.
[01:02] [ ... Silence (11s) ... ]
[01:13] [Receptionist]: Well, as I can see, this case is still being handled under our hands.
[01:19] [Vanessa]: Oh, okay.
[01:20] [Receptionist]: It was never- it was never transferred. So there still haven't been any type of, um, settlement yet. This- this is still in litigation.
[01:30] [Vanessa]: Yeah, that's what I have. That it's in litigation, but then Mabel- I'm trying to get the date, but Mabel from the office, uh, said- she was the one that wrote to us that it's being handled by Bain and Associates. Sorry, by- to- by Calvin Smith for the litigation.
[01:49] [Receptionist]: Oh.
[01:50] [Vanessa]: So maybe it never went?
[01:52] [Receptionist]: No, it didn't. I- I don't think it ever did. This was reassigned to another attorney, um, under our hands.
[02:01] [Vanessa]: Oh, okay.
[02:02] [Receptionist]: And, yeah. Let me see what I have here. Um...
[02:05] [Vanessa]: I have- so Daniel Johnson, does he work for Bain and Associates?
[02:11] [ ... Silence (5s) ... ]
[02:16] [Vanessa]: 'Cause his email is from Calvin Smith. Yeah.
[02:20] [Receptionist]: No.
[02:21] [Vanessa]: No.
[02:22] [Receptionist]: No, he does not work for Bain and Associates.
[02:24] [Vanessa]: Okay. So, and- and can you confirm with me you have the bill and records on file?
[02:29] [Receptionist]: Let me take a look.
[02:31] [ ... Silence (7s) ... ]
[02:38] [Receptionist]: Okay, so we do have the records and billing.

[02:52] [Receptionist]: Perfect.
[02:54] [Vanessa]: Okay.
[02:56] [Vanessa]: So I'm just gonna flip the account back to you guys then. Uh, I don't know why, maybe it was confused. I don't know. Um, I'm gonna switch it over and update it.
[03:09] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I don't know what- what would have happened at that moment.
[03:13] [Vanessa]: Yeah.
[03:14] [Receptionist]: Yeah, I don't know what happened at that moment.
[03:18] [Vanessa]: Yeah.
