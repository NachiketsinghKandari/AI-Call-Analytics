[00:03] [Sikma Woodson]: Yes, hi, how you doing Emma? I have a complaint, um, I have a case with you all and I'm not getting any information or anything and then when I talk to my case worker, uh, this been going on for like six months. She gives me a run-around and and I called her today just to get a update because she supposed to had uh uh got back with me within, you know, and she's getting an attitude and she's like she's uh upset because I'm calling to try to get information on my case. So, I'm just trying to see like what should I do because I don't— I'm helpless right now. I don't know if I should get call another lawyer office and see what I should do. I I don't— I'm so confused.

And my case uh worker name is Loni. I even asked for the uh the office number to see if I can talk with someone else to see if I can get a little bit more help and she was just yelling at me and she told me she don't even have that information and she works for you all. That just seems a little— she said she's she don't have that information, the number I just called. I had to look you all up to get the information. She didn't even— I she couldn't even give me information on y'all law firm. And I find that a little strange.
