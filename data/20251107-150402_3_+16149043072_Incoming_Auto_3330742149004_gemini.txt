[00:10] [Receptionist]: Kamy.
[00:12] [Danielle Ross]: Kamy, I am calling to make an initial offer on a client, Christopher Harris.
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Okay, let me get it pulled up here.
[00:22] [ ... Silence (24s) ... ]
[00:47] [Receptionist]: That is with Ms. Lonnie, but she... let me get her for you.
[00:49] [Danielle Ross]: Yes, please.
[00:51] [Receptionist]: Ma'am, I was unable to get a hold of Lonnie or- nor the attorney. I don't know if you want to leave a message for either one? Voicemail?
[01:02] [Danielle Ross]: Yeah, either one's fine.
[01:04] [Receptionist]: Okay, I'll say... okay, so the- he is calling right now, one second. The attorney.
[01:12] [Danielle Ross]: Mhm.
[01:13] [Receptionist]: Okay, um, so he is still at his conference, so a voicemail would be good, he said. He would get back to you.
[01:24] [Danielle Ross]: Okay. Thanks, Kamy.
[01:26] [Receptionist]: All right, sending you over. Have a great rest of your day.
