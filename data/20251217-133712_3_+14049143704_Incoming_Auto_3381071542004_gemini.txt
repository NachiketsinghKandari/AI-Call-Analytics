[06:51] [Mario Gooch]: Out of the blue.
[06:53] [Receptionist]: Out of the blue, rear-ended you.
[06:56] [Mario Gooch]: Right. Well, the lady explained that she hit the gas— she made a mistake to hit the gas instead of hitting the brake.

[ ... Silence (20s) ... ]

[08:53] [Mario Gooch]: Uh, the police were called, but they didn't come to the scene.
[08:58] [Receptionist]: Reason being?
[09:00] [Mario Gooch]: Reason being they said it was private property and we should just exchange information. But I have, uh, records I can show that I called them, or at least I called the police.

[ ... Silence (10s) ... ]

[09:28] [Receptionist]: Um, okay. So the authorities were called into the scene, but they— they just didn't get to the scene. Okay, so there was no report. And who called the police? Did you call the police?
[09:40] [Mario Gooch]: Yes. Because I thought that I would need like a police report or something, like an incident or a report. But they were saying that it's private property and we just need to exchange information. So that's what we did.
[10:06] [Receptionist]: That's insane, right? How can they say private property? You were in a restaurant, come on.
[10:13] [Mario Gooch]: Right. Also, um, uh, they— they have paid $1,000 for the bumper that was damaged too.

[10:37] [Receptionist]: And the person that hit you was the person that gave you the money?
[10:42] [Mario Gooch]: No, the insurance company.
[10:45] [Receptionist]: Insurance from— from the other person?
[10:49] [Mario Gooch]: Correct.

[ ... Silence (14s) ... ]

[11:05] [Receptionist]: Um, okay. But you received the $1,000, right?
[11:08] [Mario Gooch]: For the— the damage for the car.
[11:13] [Receptionist]: Yeah, that's going to be an issue because if you receive the money, that is— that's going to be like you already settled.
[11:21] [Mario Gooch]: Uh, but they put— they put the same another bodily injury claim in. So the claim— the bodily injury claim adjuster called back to see... you see what I'm saying?
[11:41] [Receptionist]: Uh-huh.

[ ... Silence (10s) ... ]

[11:53] [Receptionist]: No. Yes, one second. For bodily injuries. And they're trying to settle with you for the bodily injuries?
