[00:00] [Receptionist]: (Background noise)
[00:05] [Receptionist]: Good morning, [unclear] speaking.
[00:06] [Leah]: Hi, yes, my name is Leah. I called a while ago but it- the background was so loud and the gentleman said that he would be calling me back, but I haven't heard anything. I just have a few questions.
[00:18] [Receptionist]: Are you an existing client with us?
[00:21] [Leah]: I'm sorry?
[00:22] [Receptionist]: Are you an existing client with us?
[00:25] [Leah]: No, I'm not. Actually, you guys have a client with you guys and they referred me to you guys and I just want to just- just see- just to get some little bit answers before I decide.
[00:37] [Receptionist]: Okay, go ahead and let's see if I can help you with any.
[00:41] [Leah]: Yes, so my mom got into a car accident a few months ago, about- about no more than two months ago, and she accidentally hit that APS school bus. Um, they didn't have no damage or nothing, her car is actually damaged and she accidentally- she was just trying to make a left turn, but the bus- the- the- the back part of the bus was kind of sticking out a little bit and she didn't notice that it was that far sticking out, so she scraped her whole passenger side and when- when she was trying to make a left, but she still got- she got the fine- the police gave her the ticket saying that it was her fault because the bus wasn't driving, it was still still, but because she wanted to turn her left, she was driving. So they gave her that ticket. And so now they're saying- um, so they were like, you know, you can't pay the fee over the phone, the ticket, but she would have to come to court and just see what the judge will say about how much they'll charge her or whatever is the fee- um, you know, to- to pay I guess. But the- but the bus wasn't damaged or anything of that nature, but my mom's car is though. So I just wanted to see what would happen, uh, once she goes to court and what would, you know, what the judge is gonna say to her. Like, how do you go about it?
[02:00] [Receptionist]: Okay, um, so we are an injury firm. We take the case- we take cases once there was personal injuries involved. Yes, your mom would have to go to the court and then see what the judge, um, you know, fight the- the citation. Um, but we wouldn't be able to, you know, tell you what the judge would say or what- what their final thoughts would be on it.
[02:27] [Leah]: Okay.
[02:28] [Receptionist]: Yes, ma'am.
[02:29] [Leah]: Okay.
[02:29] [Receptionist]: And because she was at fault then we would not be able to assist even if she was hurt.
[02:35] [Leah]: Oh, okay. Okay, so- okay, I got you. So regardless she gonna- so she would have to just go without- without no lawyer?
[02:44] [Receptionist]: Yes, ma'am. She has to go and fight the citation.
[02:48] [Leah]: Okay, okay. 'Cause- 'cause we were trying to pay it over the phone and I didn't know that, but they were like, "No- no, you can't pay over the phone that- that ticket, you're gonna have to show up to court to hear what the judge will say."
[03:02] [Receptionist]: Mhm. That is correct.
[03:04] [Leah]: Okay. Okay, thank you so much. And that's because- and that's because it's a- it's a APS bus, correct? 'Cause it's a- it's a city bus? Is that why she gotta go to court?
[03:14] [Receptionist]: No, not really. Once they give you a citation, you have to go and fight it in court.
[03:21] [Leah]: Okay. Okay.
[03:22] [Receptionist]: Regardless. Mhm.
[03:24] [Leah]: Okay, thank you.
[03:25] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. You have a great rest of your day.
[03:28] [Leah]: Thank you, too. Bye-bye.
