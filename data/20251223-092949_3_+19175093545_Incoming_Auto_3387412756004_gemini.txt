[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, Kim speaking?
[00:05] [Speaker 2]: Yes, I'm trying to get a consultation to find out if I have a case or not for bad faith, um, homeowners insurance.
[00:16] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, yeah, we don't do those type of cases. We are injury firm, so it has to be personal injury in order for us to be able to assist.
[00:27] [Speaker 2]: I'm sorry, this is Bey and Associates, right?
[00:30] [Receptionist]: Yes, sir.
[00:32] [Speaker 2]: Uh, pretty sure I saw on your site that you do bad faith. I mean, I see Atlanta bad faith insurance lawyers, like, that's on your site.
[00:46] [Receptionist]: It's okay. Let me, uh, get someone that can help with that then. One second.
[00:55] [ ... Silence (63s) ... ]
[01:58] [Receptionist]: Sir? Um, I spoke to the supervisor and he said if it doesn't involve personal injury then no, we are not taking those types of cases.
[02:17] [Speaker 2]: Okay. Sure. Yeah, you should probably, you should probably update your website because that's really misleading. Thank you.
[02:26] [Receptionist]: You're welcome, sir. Have a great rest of your day.
