So I didn't know what was going on. So when I get, um, get close to the guardrails, you know, I climb out the window, like it all jumped to fire or something. So I'm climbing out the window, I see a car over there backwards, like an Infiniti over there backwards. Backwards. And, um, when he was backwards, I'm like what's going on? So I said why you hit my car? Then he just, he says man, I got you, I got you. And then he just grabbed my bumper, I mean him and his, it was two guys, a girl too. And, um, they stood to the back of the car, I don't know if they changed the tag or whatever, and, um, next thing I know, they just getting in the car, he start pulling off and they start running with the bumper.
[03:21] [Shawn Benton]: Yeah, they start running with the bumper, ma'am. Yeah, so I don't know, I don't know if he was on drugs thinking that that was his bumper, but he ran, but I told the police and then when my car was on the, um, was on the street parked, I think another, I think he hit somebody else's car trying to get away.

[12:24] [Shawn Benton]: I'm sorry?
[12:25] [Shawn Benton]: So, um, yeah, I need somebody to go get that car from the, what they call, from the impound yard. I already told them that I did everything, I provided all the information of where the car was and all that.

[12:44] [Receptionist]: Okay. Yeah, absolutely. They'll get in contact with you for that because it is your insurance. You please do let them know that you have hired an attorney, and if they ask, you can give them our office number, of course. Um, after you sign, the attorney and a case manager will be assigned to you, and they should contact you because today is Saturday and I don't have an attorney at the office, um, today. They will most likely wait until Monday morning to go ahead and, um, get in contact with you, okay?
