----------------------------------------

[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates Law Firm, this is Karina, how can I help you?
[00:06] [Kurt Reynolds]: Hey, Karina, good afternoon. Um, I was just calling again to try to, uh, get some information. I had a deposition practice that was supposed to be, I think, scheduled this afternoon for 2:00 PM, but I've got— I haven't gotten like any Zoom details about that.
[00:21] [Receptionist]: Okay. Can I ask your name, sir?
[00:23] [Kurt Reynolds]: Yes, it's Kurt Reynolds.
[00:27] [Receptionist]: Give me just a moment, let me get the...
[00:33] [Kurt Reynolds]: Okay.
[00:37] [Receptionist]: All right. Let me try to get the case manager on the line so that he can explain, okay? Just bear with me.
[00:44] [Kurt Reynolds]: Okay.
[00:45] [Receptionist]: Thank you.
[00:50] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for holding, Mr. Reynolds. Uh, Kevin, which is the case manager, is not available right now. Would you like his voicemail?
[00:58] [Kurt Reynolds]: Um, uh, well, I mean, not at this time. I will just try to, um— if it's possible, and I apologize, I'm talking to you about this, I would just want to see if someone could kind of get back with me because I've been calling for the last couple of weeks trying to kind of get more information on this, um, and it's gotten a little bit frustrated. I have not really, like, there hasn't been any follow-through at all. Like, I think Kevin has told me several times, "Hey, I'm going to reach out and I'm going to get this over to you." So it's like, you know, I've taken off of work for this and the deposition scheduled, and I know everybody's busy, but it's just kind of like I need some— I at least need somebody to tell me like, "Hey, this isn't happening" or, you know what I mean? So if— if like, I mean, if you can, you know...
[01:46] [Receptionist]: Yeah. Let me— yeah. Let me see who can assist you with this. The— I would love to assist you, you know, much more, but I'm not an attorney and I'm not a case manager.
[01:56] [Kurt Reynolds]: Yeah. No, I know. It's— yeah, it's nothing you can do about it. Exactly.
[02:00] [Receptionist]: Yeah. But let me— let me try to get someone, maybe they can assist, okay? Just give me one moment.
[02:05] [Kurt Reynolds]: Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm.
[02:07] [Receptionist]: Thank you.
[02:11] [Receptionist]: Thank you so much for holding, Mr. Reynolds. I'm so sorry. I've tried everybody right now, it's just that nobody's available. So what I could do is transfer you to, uh, the attorney's direct voicemail and you can leave a message to Taylor, and her name is Taylor, and she should be getting back—
[02:23] [Kurt Reynolds]: Taylor. Okay.
[02:24] [Receptionist]: Yes.
[02:25] [Kurt Reynolds]: Okay, perfect. Thank you so very much.
[02:27] [Receptionist]: All right, you're welcome. One moment here. I will also make sure to send an email to her, okay?
[02:33] [Kurt Reynolds]: Okay. Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it.
[02:36] [Receptionist]: You're welcome. Thank you.
