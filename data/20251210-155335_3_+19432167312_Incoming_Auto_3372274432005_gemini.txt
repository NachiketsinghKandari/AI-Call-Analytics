[00:00] [Receptionist]: Bey and Associates, Amy speaking?
[00:04] [Unknown]: Hey, how are you?
[00:06] [Receptionist]: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I help?
[00:10] [Unknown]: Yes, um, my granddaughter, um, has a case there, so, um, she's not sure who's her attorney. Um, and she's now 18 and she's just trying to find out, um, who her attorney is.
[00:26] [Receptionist]: Can I have her name?
[00:31] [Ivyunna Smith]: Ivyunna Smith. I-V-Y-U-N-N-A S-M-I-T-H.
[00:46] [Receptionist]: One sec, Ms. Smith.
[00:47] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[00:56] [Receptionist]: Okay, could you spell your name one more time for me?
[00:59] [Ivyunna Smith]: I-V-Y-U-N-N-A.
[01:07] [ ... Silence (15s) ... ]
[01:22] [Receptionist]: What was the date of loss?
[01:25] [Ivyunna Smith]: It was like February this year. Either the end of January or the beginning of February.
[01:37] [ ... Silence (12s) ... ]
[01:49] [Receptionist]: What type of accident was it?
[01:52] [Ivyunna Smith]: It was a rear-ended car accident with the Uber driver.
[01:58] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[02:07] [Receptionist]: Just one sec, my system is a little slow today.
[02:12] [ ... Silence (9s) ... ]
[02:21] [Unknown]: And what happened was, the reason why we haven't called before because her mom was supposed to have been handling all of this. But her youngest son had had an accident too, I guess she was just too overwhelmed and had, I don't know. So, um, we're just checking on it now to see.
[02:38] [Receptionist]: Is your mom's name, um, Kierra Giles?
[02:47] [Unknown]: Yes.
[02:52] [Receptionist]: And you said that this happened this year?
[02:56] [Unknown]: Yes.
[02:58] [Receptionist]: I do have a— I do have a file here, but, okay, so your birthday is May 23rd, 2007?
[03:10] [Ivyunna Smith]: Yes.
[03:12] [Receptionist]: I do have a— a file here under that name, but the accident happened in 2016.
[03:22] [Unknown]: No. No. No, that's— that was her accident. That was the mom's accident 2016. Daughter had an accident in the Uber, um, she was with— riding with an Uber.
[03:36] [Receptionist]: Okay, and your mom signed you up?
[03:41] [Ivyunna Smith]: Yes. But she just had a lot going on.
[03:44] [Receptionist]: All right. Just one second because there's only one file under your name. Let me, um, let me get with my supervisor to see if we could find it in somewhere else. Uh, let's see.
[03:51] [ ... Silence (16s) ... ]
[04:07] [Receptionist]: Ms. Smith?
[04:08] [Ivyunna Smith]: Yes.
[04:09] [Receptionist]: Um, so, uh, I just got off the phone with our supervisor and we both looked and we cannot find anything other than the— that one that I told you about that happened in 2016. We can't find anything under your mom's name also.
[04:29] [Unknown]: Okay, well, how do she— is it too late to retain you guys?
[04:34] [Receptionist]: Um, has she completed treatment?
[04:38] [Unknown]: Um, well she was actually kind of waiting on him because she before— uh, she really didn't know what was going on before that. Uh, she had also been in an auto accident, she was at the red light and somebody rear-ended her and she got pushed up under of a bus. So she after that treatment, you know, so I don't know, it's kind of confusing right now. But she's now 18 and she's trying to get this resolved.
[05:06] [Receptionist]: Okay, and you said that this happened in February?
[05:09] [Unknown]: Yes.
[05:11] [Receptionist]: If she hasn't received any treatment for this, then we would not be able to assist.
[05:18] [Unknown]: Well she did go to the hospital.
[05:22] [Receptionist]: Just— just the hospital?
[05:25] [Unknown]: Yes.
[05:26] [Receptionist]: Okay. Um, all right, let me see. Let me see again with the supervisor, one second.
[05:36] [Unknown]: Okay.
[05:42] [Receptionist]: Ms. Smith, um, so I just asked and unfortunately no, just for one hospital visit, we would not be able to represent her.
[05:49] [Unknown]: Because they had— the mom said that you guys sent her some kind of psychological evaluation because she had already been involved in an accident, so she was kind of waiting on that to just determine to see what was the next move.
[06:03] [Receptionist]: Okay, if she can send us over any information, I mean, like I said, we don't have anything in our system, not from your daughter, nor from— nor that has anything with your granddaughter's name other than the— that file that I told you guys about.
[06:23] [Unknown]: Okay, and it's Kierra, Kierra, K-E-A-E-R-R-A, not Tiera.
[06:30] [Receptionist]: Okay, can I have it again?
[06:33] [Unknown]: K-E-A-E-R-R-A.
[06:42] [Receptionist]: Okay.
[06:43] [ ... Silence (8s) ... ]
[06:51] [Receptionist]: And her last name would be?
[06:53] [Unknown]: Giles, G-I-L-E-S.
[06:54] [ ... Silence (15s) ... ]
[07:09] [Receptionist]: Okay, K-E... Okay, I do find one here. Let me see if I could verify her— her date of birth. Is it 12/29/1988— 88, I mean?
[07:18] [Unknown]: Yes. Yes.
[07:21] [Receptionist]: All right, so this one is... let me see. This one also was for the date of loss, one second. So it's already a file that is closed and this happened in March 30th, 2019.
[07:35] [ ... Silence (7s) ... ]
[07:42] [Unknown]: No, that was old. Okay, thank you.
[07:45] [Receptionist]: You're welcome.
